Bowman’s wife Betty, 32, died four days after she was admitted to the hospital and her death was flagged as suspicious, NBC News reported.

Investigators from the Rochester Police Department shared Monday that they had “collected evidence that suggests Connor, who once worked for poison control, may have given Betty a drug for an ailment she did not have.”

Authorities also uncovered that the Bowmans were having financial and marital difficulties in the lead up to the death, and that the 30-year-old doc claimed he would get a large life insurance payout after her passing.

The couple was “talking about a divorce following infidelity and a deteriorating relationship,” the criminal complaint stated.

Betty first entered the hospital in mid-August with symptoms of diarrhea and dehydration. She later suffered from cardiac issues, organ failure, and even had to undergo surgery to remove part of her colon, according to the complaint.

Connor Bowman requested to have her body cremated after her death, but the process was halted when the medical examiner’s office determined her death was suspicious.

The Southeast Minnesota Medical Examiner’s Office alerted police later that month, and although the female suspect was not named in the complaint, police later identified her as Betty Bowman.","Minnesota doctor Connor Bowman was arrested for poisoning his wife, Betty, who died suddenly after being admitted to the hospital in August.

2023-10-25T00:00:00.0000000,Jenna Ellis becomes latest Trump lawyer to plead guilty over efforts to ...,https://news.yahoo.com/jenna-ellis-becomes-latest-trump-134539125.html,"ATLANTA (AP) — Attorney and prominent conservative media figure Jenna Ellis pleaded guilty Tuesday to a felony charge over efforts to overturn Donald Trump ’s 2020 election loss in Georgia, tearfully telling the judge she looks back on that time with “deep remorse.”

Ellis, the fourth defendant in the case to enter into a plea deal with prosecutors, was a vocal part of Trump's reelection campaign in the last presidential cycle and was charged alongside the Republican former president and 17 others with violating the state’s anti-racketeering law.

Ellis pleaded guilty to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. She had been facing charges of violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, and soliciting the violation of oath by a public officer, both felonies.

She rose to speak after pleading guilty, fighting back tears as she said she would not have represented Trump after the 2020 election if she knew then what she knows now, claiming that she relied on lawyers with much more experience than her and failed to verify the things they told her.

“What I did not do but should have done, Your Honor, was to make sure that the facts the other lawyers alleged to be true were in fact true,” the 38-year-old Ellis said.

The guilty plea from Ellis comes just days after two other defendants, fellow attorneys Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, entered guilty pleas. That means three high-profile people responsible for pushing baseless legal challenges to Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory have agreed to accept responsibility for their roles rather than take their chances before a jury. A lower-profile defendant pleaded guilty last month.

Responding to a reporter's shouted question in the hallway of a New York City courthouse, where a civil case accusing him of inflating the value of his assets is being held, Trump said he didn't know anything about Ellis' plea deal but called it “too bad” and said he wasn't worried by it.

“Don't know anything, we're totally innocent of everything, that's political persecution is all it is,” he said.

Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the Georgia case, used Ellis' plea to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the racketeering charges Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis brought against all 19 defendants.

“For the fourth time, Fani Willis and her prosecution team have dismissed the RICO charge in return for a plea to probation,” he said. “What that shows is this so-called RICO case is nothing more than a bargaining chip for DA Willis.”

He also noted that Ellis pleaded guilty to a charge that wasn't in the original indictment and doesn't include Trump.

She was sentenced to five years of probation along with $5,000 in restitution, 100 hours of community service, writing an apology letter to the people of Georgia and testifying truthfully in trials related to this case.

The early pleas and the favorable punishment — probation rather than prison — could foreshadow similar outcomes for additional defendants who may see an admission of guilt and cooperation as their best hope for leniency. Even so, their value as witnesses against Trump is unclear given that their direct participation in unfounded schemes will no doubt expose them to attacks on their credibility and bruising cross-examinations should they testify.

The indictment in the sweeping case details a number of accusations against Ellis, including that she helped author plans on how to disrupt and delay congressional certification of the 2020 election’s results on Jan. 6, 2021, the day a mob of Trump supporters eventually overran the U.S. Capitol.

Ellis is also accused of urging state legislators to unlawfully appoint a set of presidential electors loyal to Trump at a hearing in Pennsylvania, and she later appeared with some of those lawmakers and Trump at a meeting on the topic at the White House. The indictment further says she similarly pushed state lawmakers to back false, pro-Trump electors in Georgia as well as Arizona and Michigan.

Prosecutor Daysha Young said in court Tuesday that Ellis attended a December 2020 meeting of Georgia state senators with Trump attorney and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and with Georgia-based attorney Ray Smith. Ellis “intentionally aided and abetted” the other two as they made false statements to the lawmakers, including that more than 2,500 people convicted of felonies, more than 66,000 people who were under 18 and more than 10,000 dead people voted in the 2020 election in Georgia, Young said.

Before her plea, Ellis, who lives in Florida, was defiant, posting in August on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, “The Democrats and the Fulton County DA are criminalizing the practice of law. I am resolved to trust the Lord.”

But she has been more critical of Trump since then, saying on conservative radio in September that she wouldn't vote for him again, citing his “malignant, narcissistic tendency to simply say that he's never done anything wrong.""

Along with Giuliani, Ellis was a leading voice in the Trump campaign's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, appearing frequently on television and conservative media to tell lies about widespread fraud that did not occur and spread misinformation and conspiracy theories.

She was censured in Colorado in March after admitting she made repeated false statements about the 2020 election.

That punishment was due in part to a Nov. 20, 2020, appearance on Newsmax, during which she said, ""With all those states (Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia) combined we know that the election was stolen from President Trump, and we can prove that.”

Powell pleaded guilty to six misdemeanors and was sentenced to serve six years of probation and was ordered to pay a fine of $6,000. Chesebro pleaded guilty to one felony and was ordered to serve five years of probation, pay $5,000 in restitution and do 100 hours of community service. Bail bondsman Scott Graham Hall pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges and got five years of probation. All of them were ordered to write apology letters to the people of Georgia and to testify truthfully in any other trial in the case.

Ellis and the other three pleaded guilty under Georgia’s first offender law. That means that if they complete their probation without violating the terms or committing another crime, their records will be wiped clean.

Trump and the other defendants, including his White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have pleaded not guilty.

With the state’s 155 hospitals reporting net income of $942 million last year, hospitals in the 18 largest health systems had operating margins — excess revenue after deducting operating costs — of 5.5%, according to the annual financial report by the Wisconsin Hospital Association. But in providing services that can lose money, such as nursing homes, home health care and dialysis centers, the health systems had operating margin losses of 0.1%, the report said.

The hospitals and health systems are “facing their most significant financial challenges in more than a decade,” WHA said in a statement. “These financial strains are in large part due to patients slowly returning to pre-pandemic routine care and the rising costs for medical supplies and services due to record inflation.”

The cost of supplies and services has increased nearly 27% since 2019, while labor costs have gone up nearly 14% and capital costs have risen 6% during that period, WHA said.

The vast majority of hospitals in Wisconsin are nonprofits, but they need operating margins sufficient to reinvest in services and secure loans for capital projects, WHA has said.

In Madison, the financial picture last year was mixed.

SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital had net income of $15.9 million, for an operating margin of 9.5%. That’s down from $78 million and a margin of 10.8% in 2021, and a gain of $109.9 million and a margin of 17.9% the previous year.

UW Hospital reported a 4.1% operating margin last year, but had a net income loss of $15.5 million. UnityPoint Health-Meriter had a 3.0% margin and loss of $17 million.

Meriter’s loss reflects stock market investment losses and the rising costs of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and staffing, spokesperson Nicole Aimone said. UW Hospital faced similar “financial headwinds,” spokesperson Sara Benzel said.

In 2021, UW Hospital had the highest net income of the state’s hospitals, with $429.1 million, for an operating margin of 9.1%. The hospital also had the highest net income in 2020, with $201.5 million, for an operating margin of 5.1%.

Meriter, which has a joint operating agreement with UW Health, had net income in 2021 of $86.2 million, for an operating margin of 4.1%. In 2020, the hospital made $67.3 million, for an operating margin of 4.5%.","Wisconsin hospitals and health systems saw a slight decrease in operating margins in 2021, with net income of $942 million, down from $4 billion in 2021. High costs for supplies, services, labor and capital projects have driven operating losses for some health systems, while UW Hospital and Meriter have seen mixed financial performance."

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is seen outside the office of the Speaker of the House on Capitol Hill, Monday, Oct. 23, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans chose Rep. Mike Johnson as their latest nominee for House speaker late Tuesday, hours after an earlier pick, Rep. Tom Emmer , abruptly withdrew in the face of opposition from Donald Trump and hardline GOP lawmakers.

Johnson of Louisiana, a lower-ranked member of the House GOP leadership team, becomes the fourth Republican nominee after Emmer and the others fell short in what has become an almost absurd cycle of political infighting since Kevin McCarthy 's ouster as GOP factions jockey for power.

Refusing to unify, far-right members won’t accept a more traditional speaker and moderate conservatives don’t want a hardliner. During private balloting, Johnson won a majority, but ahead of an expected House floor vote Wednesday the nominee will need almost all Republicans to win the gavel.

“Mike! Mike! Mike!” lawmakers chanted at a press conference afterward, surrounding Johnson and posing for selfies in a show of support.

Three weeks on, the Republicans have been frittering away their majority status — a maddening embarrassment to some, democracy in action to others, but not at all how the House is expected to function.

Anxious and exhausted, Republican lawmakers are desperately trying to move on. “Pretty sad commentary on governance right now,” said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark. “Maybe on the fourth or fifth or sixth or 10th try we’ll get this thing right.”

After he withdrew Tuesday afternoon, Emmer briskly left the building where he had been meeting privately with Republicans. He said later at the Capitol that Trump's opposition did not affect his decision to bow out.

“I made my decision based on my relationship with the conference,” he said, referring to the GOP majority. He said he would support whomever emerges as the new nominee. “We'll get it done.”

Trump, speaking as he left the courtroom in New York where he faces business fraud charges, said his “un-endorsement” must have had an impact on Emmer’s bid.

“He wasn’t MAGA,"" said Trump, the party's front-runner for the 2024 presidential election, referring to his Make America Great Again campaign slogan.

House Republicans returned behind closed doors, where they spend much of their time, desperately searching for a leader who can unite the factions, reopen the House and get the U.S. Congress working again.

Attention quickly turned to Johnson, who was the second highest vote-getter on Tuesday morning's internal ballots.

A lawyer specializing in constitutional issues, Johnson had rallied Republicans around Trump’s legal effort to overturn the 2020 election results.

Elevating Johnson to speaker would giving Louisianans two high-ranking GOP leaders, putting him above Majority Leader Steve Scalise , who was rejected by hardliners in his own bid as speaker.

But hardliners swiftly resisted Johnson's bid and a new list of candidates emerged. Among them was Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida, a Trump ally who ran third on the morning ballot, and a few others.

In the end, Johnson won 128 votes on the evening ballot, more than any other candidate. McCarthy, who was not on the ballot, won a surprising 43 votes.

One idea circulating, first reported by NBC News, was to reinstall McCarthy as speaker with hardline Rep. Jim Jordan in a new leadership role.

It was being pitched as a way to unite the conference, lawmakers said, but many said it would not fly.

“I think sometimes it’s good to have fresh ideas and fresh people,” said Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind.

While Emmer won a simple majority in a morning roll call behind closed doors — 117 votes — he lost more than two dozen Republicans, leaving him far short of what will be needed during a House floor tally ahead.

Trump allies, including the influential hard-right instigator Steve Bannon, have been critical of Emmer. Some point to his support of a same-sex marriage initiative and perceived criticisms of the former president. Among the far-right groups pressuring lawmakers over the speaker’s vote, some quickly attacked Emmer.

Having rejected the top replacements, Scalise and the Trump-backed Jordan, there is no longer any obvious choice for the job.

With Republicans controlling the House 221-212 over Democrats, any GOP nominee can afford just a few detractors to win the gavel.

“We’re in the same cul-de-sac,” said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus.

Yet Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., one of the hardliners, said, “This is what democracy looks like.”

Republicans have been flailing all month, unable to conduct routine business as they fight amongst themselves with daunting challenges ahead.

The federal government risks a shutdown in a matter of weeks if Congress fails to pass funding legislation by a Nov. 17 deadline to keep services and offices running. More immediately, President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide $105 billion in aid — to help Israel and Ukraine amid their wars and to shore up the U.S. border with Mexico. Federal aviation and farming programs face expiration without action.

Coming in a steady second in the morning balloting, Johnson offered his full support to Emmer. Others were eliminated during multiple rounds of voting, including Donalds and Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, a conservative leader and former McDonald’s franchise owner who plied his colleagues with hamburgers seeking their support. Reps. Austin Scott of Georgia, Jack Bergman of Michigan, Pete Sessions of Texas, Gary Palmer of Alabama and Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania also dropped out.

Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, the hard-right leader who engineered McCarthy's ouster, has said several of those who were running — Hern, Donalds or Johnson — would make a “phenomenal” choice for speaker.

Nevertheless, Gaetz voted for Emmer, though others who joined in ousting McCarthy did not.

Many hardliners have been resisting a leader who voted for the budget deal that McCarthy struck with Biden earlier this year, which set federal spending levels that far-right Republicans don't agree with and now want to undo. They are pursuing steeper cuts to federal programs and services with next month's funding deadline.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she wanted assurances the candidates would pursue impeachment inquiries into Biden and other top Cabinet officials.

During the turmoil, the House is now led by a nominal interim speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the bow tie-wearing chairman of the Financial Services Committee. His main job is to elect a more permanent speaker.

Some Republicans — and Democrats — would like to simply give McHenry more power to get on with the routine business of governing. But McHenry, the first person to be in the position that was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as an emergency measure, has declined to back those overtures.

However, being prepared for the inevitable is not only a smart thing to do, it's also a kind thing to do for loved ones.

Failing to put your paperwork in order means family or friends will have to rely on the probate court to determine the fate of your property. Depending on your state, that could entail hiring a lawyer, paying court fees and waiting for a judge to decide how best to distribute assets.

What’s more, heirs may miss out on life insurance benefits or overlook accounts because they don't know they exist.

""If you do it right, there is additional (financial) return for your heirs,” says Travis Anderson, managing member of TBH Advisors in Brentwood, Tennessee.

That's why it's crucial for you to have important documents ready for your loved ones. Here are the 12 documents you should start preparing now:



Will.

Trust.

Letter of explanation.

List of financial accounts and beneficiaries.

Personal inventory.

Power of attorney.

Life insurance policies.

Real estate records.

Tax returns.

Login information for online accounts.

Digital estate plan.

Final wishes.

1. Will

When it comes to estate planning, a will is likely the first thing that comes to mind. This legal document lets you name an executor to carry out your wishes, heirs for your assets and a guardian for any minor children you may have.

Wills can also be used to make arrangements for pets.

""Clients frequently enjoy naming their specific pets in the will, but the provision should always include the named pets ‘and any other pets I may own at my death,’” says Lucy Marsh, a professor in the Sturm College of Law at the University of Denver. It’s a good idea to name a specific person in the will for pet care, along with a backup choice.



2. Trust

“Everyone knows the will, but the will is not the best way to pass on assets,” says Kelsey Simasko, an elder law attorney with Simasko Law in Mount Clemens, Michigan. That’s because a will still needs to go through the probate process. Instead, she recommends using a trust.

Trusts bypass probate court and also allow more control over how assets are distributed. For instance, a trust can stipulate that minor children won’t receive unfettered access to their inheritance until a specified age. That way, the money “can be used to enhance their life, not ruin their life,” Simasko says.

Even those with a trust should write a will, particularly if they are a parent to minor children. The will, rather than the trust, is where you indicate who you do – or do not – want to have guardianship.

3. Letter of Explanation

While the will or trust stipulates how assets are to be divided, a letter of explanation can provide the rationale for these decisions.



This can be especially important in instances when assets are not being divided equally. Knowing why a sibling was chosen to receive a larger share of an estate may help avoid animosity between family members.

Consider sitting down with heirs to share this information in advance.

""You can’t leave these big reveals for the lawyer,” Simasko says. If sharing this information feels awkward and uncomfortable, she suggests to her clients that they invite adult children to a meeting in her office. That way, an attorney can serve as a neutral third party to the conversation.

4. List of Financial Accounts and Beneficiaries

Maintain a list of all your finances, including bank and retirement accounts and brokerage funds. Each of these accounts can have a designated beneficiary or transfer on death provision, known as a TOD. Beneficiaries or TOD designees automatically get ownership of the asset after you pass away.

It’s not unusual for people to forget to update beneficiaries on accounts or assume they don't need to worry about beneficiaries if they have a will. However, whoever is named beneficiary receives the asset even if the will says otherwise.

For that reason, it’s important to revisit these documents regularly. “Your estate plan changes just like your life does,” Anderson says.

5. Personal Inventory

Most wills distribute personal property in broad terms, such as designating jewelry to one person and household goods to another. To ensure nothing important gets overlooked, it's also helpful to have an inventory of personal items available.

“It helps with personal effects and alleviates a lot of stress,” Anderson says. That may be especially true if you have items stored elsewhere, such as a storage unit, that your family might not know about.

In some states, a personal property memorandum can be used to indicate who should get specific items. “This is a great way for people to be able to say who is to have various small items, such as fishing poles, special bits of jewelry, special quilts, dishes, and the like,” Marsh says.

“Only tangible personal property – things you can pick up and hold (excluding money) – can be included on one of these memorandums,” Marsh adds. What’s more, the memorandum is valid only if it's mentioned in the will.

6. Power of Attorney

A power of attorney form isn't something that will be used by heirs, but it is an important document for your loved ones to have should you become incapacitated because of an illness or accident. The power of attorney will let a designated person make decisions on your behalf.

Some people designate one person to be a power of attorney for both financial and health care decisions while others prefer to split these responsibilities between two people. Depending on state law, medical decisions may be made by a medical power of attorney or a health care designee once someone has been deemed incapacitated by medical professionals.

“A living will is a backup for a medical power of attorney,” Marsh says. “The provisions of a living will specify at what point life support should be terminated.”



7. Life Insurance Policies

People may be missing out on significant life insurance benefits because they don't realize a family member had a policy – or, it has been lost or misplaced. Make sure your loved ones get the money they are owed by keeping records of your life insurance plans and storing them with your financial papers.

8. Real Estate Records

Deeds, assessments, mortgage statements and tax information for real estate should also be included with the documents you've prepared for your heirs. Unless you own a significant number of rental units, your heirs will likely already know what property you own, but gathering the records for them in advance will make their lives a little easier.

Also, consider putting deeds for property you’d like heirs to split in a trust. Some people may put a child on a deed with the idea that the property will be sold and proceeds split with siblings. However, if that child wants to keep the property for themselves, “It’s very hard to go to court and force the sale of the property,” Simasko says.

9. Tax Returns

If you have your taxes done professionally, record the name of your certified public accountant or tax preparer. That person will be able to guide your family through filing final tax returns for your estate. If you file your own returns, don't forget to print a copy for your files and record any login information for online tax preparation services.

10. Login Information for Online Accounts

Create a record of your usernames and passwords for financial accounts, email and social media platforms and store it in a location where heirs can access the information.

If you use a password manager, such as LastPass, you may be able to designate a person for emergency access to your account. Include instructions on how to access this feature with your other documents.

11. Digital Estate Plan

Given that we spend much of our lives online and on the computer, it's become increasingly important to have digital estate plans in addition to a traditional will. Some states recognize these plans as legally binding, but even if they're not, they can still be a helpful tool for your friends and family.

A digital estate plan outlines what will happen to your digital assets. This includes social media accounts, websites, digital photos, intellectual property, and other files and documents. Within your plan, you can even designate a digital executor and list those you've named as legacy contacts on specific platforms such as Facebook.

12. Final Wishes

If you've made prearrangements for your funeral or cremation, keep that information with your will and other end-of-life documents. If you haven't made prearrangements but have specific wishes, list those as well.

“Burial or memorial instructions seem to be one of the most important documents to avoid family fights after a person dies,” Marsh says. “It's actually a great relief to the family to know what the person would have wanted.”","or- mation in advance. That way, they can come to terms with the decision.Preparing for the inevitable is not only smart but it is a kind thing to do for those we leave behind.

Chapter 1: Global Financial Stability Overview: Markets in the Time of COVID-19

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses unprecedented health, economic, and financial stability challenges. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the prices of risk assets collapsed and market volatility spiked, while expectations of widespread defaults led to a surge in borrowing costs. Several factors amplified asset price moves: previously overstretched asset valuations, pressures to unwind leveraged trades, dealers’ balance-sheet constraints, and a deterioration in market liquidity. Emerging market economies experienced the sharpest reversal of portfolio flows on record. As a result, financial conditions tightened at an unprecedented speed. Decisive monetary, financial, and fiscal policy actions—aimed at containing the fallout from the pandemic—managed to stabilize investor sentiment in late March–early April, with markets paring back some of their losses.

A further tightening of financial conditions may expose more “cracks” in global financial markets and test the resilience of financial institutions. Asset managers may face further outflows and may be forced to sell assets into falling markets. Distress may rise among leveraged firms and households. Emerging and frontier markets may face challenging external funding conditions, rising rollover risks, and increased incidence of debt restructurings. Although banks have more capital and liquidity than in the past, have been subject to stress tests, and are supported by central bank liquidity provision, their resilience may be tested in some countries in the face of large market and credit losses. Wide-ranging fiscal, monetary, and financial policies, as well as strong international cooperation, remain essential to safeguard economic and financial stability and to prevent the emergence of adverse macro-financial feedback loops.","The coronavirus pandemic has caused unprecedented health, economic, and financial stability challenges. Asset prices have fallen and market volatility has increased, leading to a rise in borrowing costs and portfolio outflows from emerging markets. Market stabilization has been achieved through decisive policy actions, but if financial conditions tighten further, distress may arise in leveraged firms and households. To protect economic and financial stability, wide-ranging fiscal, monetary, and financial policies are needed, along with strong international cooperation."

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — A Texas county near New Mexico — where abortion is legal — has banned helping people traveling to get an abortion in one of the newest ways conservatives are trying to restrict abortion access since the fall of Roe v. Wade.

Lubbock County is the largest of four Texas counties that have now adopted a version of the measure, which would be enforced through lawsuits filed by private citizens against people who help women obtain abortions. It is the same legal mechanism Texas used to enact a strict abortion law in 2021 before the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the state last year to ban nearly all abortions entirely.

Commissioners in the west Texas county adopted the measure 3-0 at a meeting Monday, rejecting some requests to postpone the vote.

The ordinance ""has many legal problems,” said Lubbock County Judge Curtis Parrish, the county's top elected official. “This ordinance, however, does not have a problem with its intent or the intent of those who are passionate about this.""

The measures expand on city ordinances rural Texas cities began passing in 2019 to ban abortion within their boundaries, even if the cities did not have a clinic performing abortions. Critics have attacked the campaign as an effort to intimidate women from seeking abortions in places where it remains legal.

Mark Lee Dickson, a Texas pastor who has led the efforts, praised the vote.

“Guys, I long for the day (when), coast to coast, abortion is considered a great moral, social and political wrong and is outlawed in every single state,” Dickson told commissioners.

No violations of the travel prohibition have been reported in the counties with similar measures already on the books. The measures would not punish women who are seeking the abortion but would present legal risks to people who help transport them to get the procedure.

Legal experts have questioned whether the ordinances could be enforced.

“We haven’t had this kind of issue tested, so it’s really kind of a case of first impression,” said Seema Mohapatra, a health law expert and law professor at Southern Methodist University.

The Lubbock County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment on the ban or its implementation.

Lubbock County has about 317,000 residents and far outnumbers the population of the three other Texas counties — Mitchell, Goliad and Cochran — that have approved the ordinance in recent months, with each county's population counting fewer than 10,000 residents. Highways through Lubbock County run to New Mexico, which has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the U.S.

The ban does not apply to cities within Lubbock County, including the city of Lubbock, which has about 264,000 of the county's residents. Lubbock voters in 2021 adopted a similar measure.

“Texans already live under some of the most restrictive and dangerous abortion bans in the country, yet anti-abortion extremists continue to push additional unnecessary, confusing and fear-inducing barriers to essential healthcare,” said Autumn Keiser, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.

Texas is one of 13 states that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In August, a Texas judge ruled that the state's ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications. But that ruling was swiftly put on hold following an appeal by the state.

The Texas law was passed prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that allowed abortions nationwide.

___

An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that two New Mexico counties had also passed similar measures.","Lubbock County, TX commissioners voted to ban drivers from transporting people seeking an abortion - making it the largest of four Texas counties to pass such a measure. The ordinance is a way for conservatives to further restrict abortion access since the Supreme Court ruling and is an effort to intimidate women from seeking abortions where it remains legal."

BRIDGEPORT — It's unclear how much money John Gomes' campaign raised, with less than two weeks to go before Election Day and amid a legal battle over who won the Democratic primary for mayor.

Gomes has yet to file the required fundraising and expense report that was due Oct. 10.

As a result the town clerk notified the campaign that it, per statute, must submit the paperwork and pay a $100 fine or the matter will be referred to the State Elections Enforcement Commission. That body could impose heftier fines of up to $2,000 and/or even refer the case to the Office of the Chief State's attorney for criminal investigation.

""Being late is not uncommon,"" Assistant Bridgeport Town Clerk Christina Resto said Wednesday. ""Usually they pay the late fee and then we move on. It's rare we're referring anything to elections enforcement.""

But, Resto continued, so far there has been no communication from Gomes' organization. Meanwhile Gomes has said during his ongoing bid to oust fellow Democrat Mayor Joe Ganim that he will run a more transparent government.

""We'll take care of it accordingly,"" Gomes said Tuesday.

He argued his campaign staff has been focused on efforts to overturn Ganim's slim Sept. 12 party primary victory in court — the same reasoning his campaign manager offered last week when contacted by Hearst Connecticut Media. Gomes filed a lawsuit Sept. 19 alleging that the election was tainted by voter fraud. The three-day trial wrapped up last Thursday and state Superior Court Judge William Clark gave the sides until this Friday to file written arguments.

As it stands, Ganim will appear on the Nov. 7 general election ballot as the Democrat while Gomes secured the endorsement of the Independent third party and is running on its ballot line.

Ganim had around $82,000 on hand as of early October, according to Ganim's financial filing which was submitted by the Oct. 10 deadline.

According to state statute, Gomes had seven days from the Oct. 16 date of the town clerk's certified letter to turn in his finance report and pay the $100 penalty. But Resto on Wednesday cited other language giving campaigns 15 days total, making her deadline for Gomes next Tuesday.

She re-emphasized that if the paperwork is not in by then, ""It will get referred to elections enforcement.""

SEEC spokesman Joshua Foley said the matter would then be investigated like any other complaint to that state agency, which has already opened 21 cases into Bridgeport's Sept. 12 primary, many of them initiated by Team Gomes or its allies.

The mayoral campaigns must also submit their final pre-Election Day fundraising and expense summaries to her office next Tuesday.

Gomes on Tuesday also disputed claims by some Ganim supporters these past few weeks that he is trying to conceal a depleted war chest and debts.

""Our campaign is in fine economic condition,"" Gomes said. ""I know there's rumors — some people trying to look for issues on our side. ... We continue to receive contributions, pay our bills and apply our strategy for November.""

His campaign manager, Christine Bartlett-Josie, on Wednesday added,""The campaign owes nobody."" She said that typically when engaged in a competitive primary she ""spends every dime operations-wise to win and then I raise more money.""

As for what their primary legal battle is costing, Bill Bloss, Gomes' attorney, on Wednesday declined to say whether he is charging or doing the work for free.

""I'm not going to comment on that right now,"" Bloss said.

Bartlett-Josie similarly would not discuss that matter.","John Gomes is running for mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut and is challenging the incumbent. His campaign failed to file the required fundraising and expense report on time, and has been notified by the town clerk that if it is not submitted and a $100 fine paid, the issue will be referred to the State Elections Enforcement Commission. Gomes has not commented on whether his primary legal battle is costing money."

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index on Monday finished down 54 points, or 0.79 per cent, at 6,772.9 after recovering somewhat from a 12-month low of 6,755.7 shortly after the open.

The broader All Ordinaries fell 54 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 6,960.2.

The risk-off trading comes off a slide of 1.1 per cent last week - the fifth week of losses out of the past six - pressured by higher bond yields, rising interest rate expectations and anxieties that regional players will get sucked into a wider conflagration arising from Israel's war with Hamas.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Monday said she remained concerned the conflict could spill over into other areas of the Middle East.

The West Texas Intermediate benchmark fell 2.9 per cent last week to $85.54 due in large part to restive conditions in the oil-producing region.

""Headlines around Gaza and, more broadly, around escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East will continue to make for choppy, volatile trading conditions in crude oil this week,"" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.

Hotter-than-expected retail sales figures for September heightened the prospect of a Melbourne Cup day rate rise.

The value of goods and services sold by Australian retailers grew by a robust 0.9 per cent, smashing the analyst consensus of 0.3 per cent.

Although primarily driven by temporary factors, the upside shock only adds to the case for the Reserve Bank to lift the cash rate to 4.35 per cent after inflation figures for the September quarter also came in stronger than predicted.

""Given the strong inflation print for Q3 and the hawkish turn in recent RBA communications, we expect to see another rate hike in November,"" said Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia.

Every sector finished in the red except for IT, which was up 0.4 per cent after the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed higher on Wall Street on Friday.

Energy was the worst hit, down 2.6 per cent, with oil giant Woodside sliding 2.5 per cent and Whitehaven Coal 5.6 per cent lower.

The heavyweight miners outperformed the index, with BHP and Fortescue Metals 0.1 per cent higher and Rio Tinto climbing 0.5 per cent.

Goldminers made strong gains as investors flocked to the safe haven commodity.

Evolution Mining firmed 0.6 per cent while mining minnow Tietto surged 32.9 per cent to 56.5c after Chinese goldminer Zhaojin offered a 58c per share takeover bid, representing a premium of 38 per cent on the previous close.

Lithium miner IGO slumped nine per cent to $9.69 after signalling volatility ahead in the market for the critical mineral.

Accounting software provider Xero was the pick of the tech stocks, up 2.2 per cent to $106.82.

The big banks all finished lower. CBA dropped 1.6 per cent, while NAB, ANZ and Westpac closed down 1.8 per cent, 1.2 per cent and 1.0 per cent respectively.

Liquor and hospitality giant Endeavour Group fell 2.2 per cent to $4.91 after investors scoffed at a 2.1 per cent increase in revenue for the September quarter.

Retail sales at the group rose 1.9 per cent as shoppers traded down to value products amid rising cost of living pressures.

Qantas lifted 0.8 per cent higher after announcing it would fight allegations of misleading conduct by the consumer watchdog.

The erstwhile consumer darling denies it misled customers by selling tickets for already-cancelled flights, arguing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission case ignores the realities of the aviation industry.

With so many incoming senior citizens preparing to retire, there are widespread fears and questions about how they will live and how they will support themselves. Doubts about how to continue to save enough money for retirement can cause plenty of anxiety. Luckily, there is guidance available.

Whether you are already enjoying your Golden Years and getting a late start in planning for your retirement or you are considering the benefits of major life decisions, such as going back to college, there are steps you can take and advice you can follow to ensure that you will be able to embrace your retirement. In this article, we will reveal essential tips and practical steps to ensure that you can benefit from a comfortable retirement, with total peace of mind. What To Know As You Begin Retirement Planning

There’s a saying — ”The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the next best time is now.” The same goes for retirement planning. The sooner you start setting aside money specifically for retirement, the more value those funds will accumulate. Your retirement income will most likely come from a few sources, including your retirement plan, your Social Security benefits, and any investments you have that continue to generate passive income.

A Financial Roadmap for a Secure Future

A general approach to saving for retirement is to save the equivalent of about twelve years of your annual income from before you retire. Often this amounts to around 1 million USD. Another approach is to follow the 4% rule, or its variations—6% and 7%. This rule encourages you to limit your annual spending each year once you retire, staying within a specified percentage of your retirement- either 4%, 6%, or 7%.

As you prepare to plan for your retirement, you will want to outline timescales, make informed budget projections, watch out for potential risks on the horizon, figure out where to invest wisely and plan for the legacy of your estate. Let’s delve deeper into each of these important steps in planning for a happy and worry-free retirement.

Set Clear Retirement Goals

First things first: as you set out to make your plans and follow your retirement saving strategies, you will want to be extra clear about what your personal goals are for your retirement. Some important categories to be aware of as you craft your retirement strategy include the following:

Estimate Your Retirement Expenses

Based on your current age and the age you plan to retire, you will want to craft a realistic estimate of how much funds you will need to have in your retirement savings.

Take an account of all of your income-generating assets and savings accounts to produce a big-picture overview of the funds that will support you in your retirement.

Risk Management

There are a number of common risks to consider that may pose problems once you are ready to retire. These concerns can include running out of savings during your retirement, unexpected expenses such as home remodels, retirement living, or medical fees, and extremely costly medical bills that can make a big dent in your savings.

Creating a risk management plan as part of your overall approach to retirement will allow you to account for these probable challenges down the line.

Creating a Stable Legacy

You want to make sure that your loved ones are comfortable and taken care of once you move on. So including estate and legacy planning in your retirement strategy is key.

To ensure a stable, lucrative legacy for your next of kin, assemble a list of your intended beneficiaries and guardians, and assign the power of attorney. Assess all of the assets you will be able to pass on and determine which of these will continue generating value even when you outlive them.

Craft A Personalized Budget

Creating a realistic budget that suits your personal needs and requirements is the best way to ensure that the savings you project will actually fit with your lifestyle.

Craft a personalized budget that allows you to set aside a particular amount each paycheck, quarter, or month. Take into account your total income, your regular expenditures, and any extra seasonal expenses (such as summer vacations or winter holiday gift-buying sprees). Most importantly, include a contingency amount for unexpected expenses.

Be honest with your assessments. The more straightforward and comprehensive your budget is, the more it will provide a realistic depiction of your future savings prospects. With all of this information, you can build up a budget you will actually stick with- and your future self will thank you for it.

Smart Investment Strategies

The best investment strategies to support you in your future retirement are those that provide stable, consistent passive income once you reach retirement. You should have a diversified portfolio with a variety of investment types to ensure long-term stability that can withstand fluctuations in the market- and your own personal life circumstances.

Investment Options for Generating Passive Income

For those who are getting close to the age of retirement, there are several types of investment options that can benefit you the most, actively supplementing your retirement savings and Social Security income.

The best investment options to support you in your retirement are:

Bonds

Annuities

Income-producing Equities

Essential Tools for Managing Your Cash Flow

Getting to know the tools available to you is a key way to ensure that you are efficiently managing cash flow within your investment ventures, which will allow you to rest easy knowing you are saving for retirement. Let’s take a look at two crucial tools for cash flow management.

Short Term Fixed Income Payouts

Rather than receiving all of the funds from your investments in one go, you can opt to use a cash flow management program that limits your payouts to short-term fixed-income deposits.

This way you will be sure to receive a regular amount without the concern of overspending.

Invoice Factoring

Generating passive income often requires a hefty initial investment, whether it’s in real estate, stocks, or your own business venture. For those who own a small business as part of their investment portfolio, maintaining a stable cash flow can sometimes be a challenge, especially when waiting for invoices to be cleared.

Some entrepreneurs opt for solutions like invoice factoring, which offers immediate cash, improves cash flow, and allows for better financial planning. These benefits make it an option worth considering as you build your diversified portfolio for early retirement.

Maximize Contributions To Your Retirement Accounts

You may already be receiving contributions to your retirement accounts from your employer or a government-funded initiative. Consider maximizing the contributions to your retirement accounts by matching the amount your employer contributes to your workplace retirement account, or match the amount you have stored up in your health savings account (HSA).

Look for tax-efficient retirement withdrawal plans, such as a Roth IRA or spousal IRA that can allow you to maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxable payouts.

Final Thoughts

Saving for retirement can be a multifaceted experience. You need to create a realistic budget, take into account your retirement savings goals, explore the clever investment options available to you, and become familiar with the helpful tools. This can allow you to maximize your cash flow and retirement savings withdrawals, and you will be in a great position to live a happy and comfortable retiree’s life.

Following these key steps will ensure that you have all you need to build up a solid financial base as you live out your golden years with confidence."," income during retirement.Research suggests that the number of Americans aged 65 and over will double from 46 million to 98 million by 2060, raising questions about how they will support themselves in retirement. There are steps and advice available to ensure that seniors have a comfortable retirement, such as setting clear retirement goals, estimating retirement expenses, managing risks, and creating a stable legacy."

2023-10-25T00:00:00.0000000,Microsoft Looks at User Protection After Log-in,https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/big-tech/microsoft-looks-at-user-protection-after-log-in/,"Microsoft wants to protect the cloud after log-in.

The company filed a patent application for a system to detect “anomalous post-authentication behavior” related to different workload identities, or the identifiers assigned to a specific task. Basically, this tech uses AI to determine if certain activity or actions taken represent a change in user behavior.

Here’s how it works: This system records activity for a period of time after a user has logged into a platform, and stores them in what Microsoft calls “audit logs.” This system may pick up on behavioral and “state change(s),” such as abnormal actions taken by certain users.

Those audit logs are then fed to an “anomaly prediction model,” which generates an “anomaly score” to determine whether certain sequences of actions are indicative of irregular behavior from that user. If the model determines that a user’s actions aren’t typical, “a mitigation action may be performed that mitigates the anomalous behavior.” For example, a user may be logged out or have their permissions to the system restricted. Alternatively, the system may notify an administrator to take further action if needed.

As more people move from on-premise servers to cloud services, the transition period creates an entryway for bad actors to gain access to their systems “in an attempt to steal and/or hold ransom sensitive data, or to leverage the massive amount of computing resources for their own malicious purposes,” Microsoft said.

But this way, security doesn’t stop at the door: If a bad actor is able to access a system with valid credentials, Microsoft’s system can catch them by monitoring the actions they take, allowing administrators to have additional security confidence.

Microsoft’s tech lines up with a common cybersecurity theme called Zero Trust, requiring all users to be continuously authorized, said Aubrey Turner, executive advisor at Ping Identity. Solutions similar to Microsoft’s already exist, said Turner, which look at signals such as device, location and reputation to decide the trustworthiness of users at any given moment. But Microsoft’s filing “goes a little further in terms of looking at the workload,” he said.

But getting tech like this to work properly is “easier said than done,” Turner noted. Scaling something like this may present a challenge, since all Software-as-a-Service apps that rely on Microsoft’s cloud platform are built differently. False positives – and false negatives – also present an issue, he said. And as a machine learning-based system, it’s only as good as the data it’s built on.

“But that shouldn’t be a deterrent in my opinion, to build something like this when post-authentication is really where we need to focus,” Turner said. “When somebody has actually completed an account takeover and they’re logging in as you … this is where I think this workload identity comes in and is looking for those inconsistencies.”

While a system like this could help mitigate digital threats from bad actors, it also implies a certain level of surveillance. This system would need to understand different user habits and activities to know which ones are anomalous. But in identity protection, walking the line between protecting user privacy and protecting a user from cyberattacks is a constant balancing act, said Turner.

“Everybody’s got something to say about how information is being used to mitigate fraud,” he said. “We need that information, we need that data to help mitigate identity attacks. But there’s that friction. Without access … the ability to mitigate identity-related fraud will now be constrained. The whole privacy thing is nuanced.”

At the end of the day, Microsoft has a major incentive to raise its cybersecurity game, especially for Microsoft Azure, which holds roughly a quarter of the market share in the cloud services industry. And following a major Azure breach from a Chinese hacking group known as Storm-0558 in July led to 25 different organizations being compromised after an engineer’s account was hacked, researching identity tech like this could help it prevent future missteps.","owng Microsoft's patent application, the company is looking to secure the cloud with AI-based post-authentication behavior detection to protect against digital threats. This tech records user actions after logging in and uses an anomaly prediction model to detect suspicious activities. However, this system also implies a certain level of surveillance and raises privacy concerns."

An ongoing investigation determined that at least 168 vehicles were involved in the crash, 63 people were injured, and an additional victim died at a local hospital, increasing the fatality count to 8 individuals.

All vehicles have been removed from both sides of I-55, and DOTD has begun the clean-up of the roadway. A comprehensive structural inspection will take place once the bridge surface is completely clear of debris, diesel and other chemicals. The reopening of the roadway will be dependent upon tests to determine the extent of damage and the scope of repairs needed.

Drivers and owners of vehicles involved in the crash who are looking for information on where their vehicle was towed are encouraged to contact Troop B by email at TroopB@la.gov. Vehicle owners looking to retrieve personal items or their vehicles from the tow yard can do so by providing proof of vehicle ownership to the tow company where their vehicle is being stored.

Original story:

At least seven people are dead after heavy fog caused more than 150 vehicles to crash Monday on Interstate 55 in Louisiana.

Public safety teams were still investigating at the site of the crash, which occurred Monday morning on both the north and southbound of the freeway, which links the greater New Orleans area with Hammond and Jackson, Mississippi along a north-south route between I-10 at Laplace and the Mississippi state line near Kentwood. A stretch of I-155 over Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans was expected to remain closed ""fore the foreseeable future.""

Heavy fog conditions led Louisiana State Police and dozens of area first responders to a multiple-car crash on Interstate 55.

More than 25 individuals were transported to area hospitals with varying degrees of injuries from critical to minor, according to state officials. Many victims sought medical assistance on their own.

""The best way you can help them, besides exercising caution on the road, is to donate blood at your local blood donation center. It will help replenish supplies that are being drained today to care for the wounded,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a released statement.

According to the Louisiana State Police, three 18-wheelers were involved and at least two were fully engulfed in flames. One tanker truck carrying a hazardous liquid was being off-loaded due to a compromised tank. Once the tanker was removed, first responders were able to better assess the vehicles in that immediate area. It is possible that additional fatalities could be located during that time.

The zero visibility conditions known as ""super fog"" affect air quality and are a combination of condensed water vapor, smoke, and moisture. On social media, the National Weather Service said there were multiple wetland fires in the south region.

Updates this morning from the US National Weather Service used a graphic map to show where the dense fog advisory is in effect. The advisory covers metro New Orleans, metro Baton Rouge, the Houma/Thibodaux area, and begins to form over northern parts of metro Baton Rouge. The dense fog advisory has also expanded to include areas around New Roads, Jackson, and St. Francisville as of this morning, There are more concerns about super fog possibly forming on I-12 between Denham Springs and Livingston.

It is advised to use low beams, slow down, keep ample distance between your vehicle and the one ahead, and do not stop on the road if you encounter dense fog.

Bel Edwards additionally asked for prayers ""for those hurt and killed in today’s tragic I-55 crash, as well as their families.""

Once the scene is clear, Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development inspectors planned to begin cleaning and inspecting the bridge. I-55 is expected to be closed for the foreseeable future.

All updates will also be posted to the Louisiana State Police Facebook page.

The FCA has been the AML and CTF supervisor of CBs since 10 January 2020. The updated Webpage announces that in the last 12 months, it has determined 79 applications. Amazingly, just five of these applications (6% of applicants) have resulted in the applicant firms becoming registered CBs, with the remainder being rejected, withdrawn, or outright refused. The Webpage has been updated to reflect further examples of good and poor practice detected by the FCA in applications for registration. With regards to the latter, the Webpage observes mistakes made by applicants when preparing an application for registration, including:

Not effectively identifying and assessing the risks of money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing, which their business is subject to. When firms draft their firm’s business-wide risk assessment (“BWRA”), the Webpage provides that applicants should include an exhaustive assessment of risk factors highlighted in regulation 18(2)(b) of the MLRs. It is stated that applicants should also provide the FCA with their risk assessment methodology outlining the steps taken to produce their risk assessment. Mistakenly identifying control failings as inherent risks. The FCA provides examples of both on the Webpage. Not adequately explaining within their business plan and risk management framework the applicant’s cryptoasset-related activities, associated risks and how these are mitigated through corresponding controls. Not sufficiently demonstrating how AML policies and procedures operate on a daily basis, including the BWRA, customer risk assessment, due diligence, screening, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting and training. The Webpage expressly provides that the FCA will not approve an application where applicants have an ‘underdeveloped’ AML framework or a ‘weak’ governance structure.

The Webpage also sets out guidance to assist applicants regarding what should be included in their application for registration. Most notably, that applicants should:

Include complete information regarding its outsourcing arrangements. Both within or outside the group, as well as within and outside the United Kingdom. Ensure that they submit a comprehensive and accurate description of their products and services, including a cryptoasset token vetting policy, detailed description of how dependent it is on external ecosystems for liquidity, custodian services and underlying smart contracts implementation, where applicable. Provide a clear methodology used for risk-scoring their customers, which drives the level of due diligence the applicant firm is required to conduct. Consider enhanced due diligence triggers, as well as levels of ongoing monitoring and the frequency of periodic reviews within their AML framework. Demonstrate that it has effective transaction monitoring and blockchain analysis, adequate for its size and complexity, including both fiat and cryptoasset transactions (where appropriate). The Website states that transaction monitoring tools should be tailored to the applicant's business offering and customer population, and reviewed regularly to ensure all rules, thresholds and scenarios remain appropriate. Have compliance staff with skills to carry out blockchain investigations, even if they have blockchain analytics tools. Ensure that its suspicious activity reporting (“SAR”) policy showcases a clear route of escalation internally to the money laundering officer or nominated officer, as well as externally to the National Crime Agency. The Webpage further provides that the SAR policy should refer to tipping off, and the circumstances where the applicant firm may need to consider a defence against money laundering SAR.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,"yearn.finance (YFI) Price Prediction 2023, 2024, 2025–2030",https://coincodex.com/crypto/yearn-finance/price-prediction/,"How to read and predict yearn.finance price movements?

yearn.finance traders use a variety of tools to try and determine the direction in which the YFI market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to predict the yearn.finance price, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall.

yearn.finance Price Prediction Indicators

Moving averages are among the most popular yearn.finance price prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for YFI over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for YFI is a sum of YFI’s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.

In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.

50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the crypto market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the YFI price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for yearn.finance. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually a sign of weakness in the YFI market.

Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the YFI price.

How to read yearn.finance charts and predict price movements?

Most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of yearn.finance with different granularity – for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular.

Let’s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into “candles” that give us information about yearn.finance’s price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display YFI’s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that yearn.finance reached within the 1-hour period.

It’s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle – a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing.

What affects the price of yearn.finance?

Just like with any other asset, the price action of yearn.finance is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental events such as block reward halvings, hard forks or new protocol updates. Regulations, adoption by companies and governments, cryptocurrency exchange hacks, and other real-world events can also affect the price of YFI. The market capitalization of yearn.finance can change significantly in a short period of time.

When trying to make a yearn.finance forecast, many traders also try to monitor the activity of YFI “whales”, which are entities and individuals that control large amounts of YFI. Since the yearn.finance market is relatively small compared to traditional markets, “whales” can single-handedly have a big influence on yearn.finance’s price movements.

Bullish and bearish price prediction patterns

Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making cryptocurrency price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

Here are some of the most commonly followed bullish candlestick patterns: Here are some common bearish candlestick patterns:

Hammer

Bullish Engulfing

Piercing Line

Morning Star

Three White Soldiers Bearish Harami

Dark Cloud Cover

Evening Star

Shooting Star

Hanging Man"," market. Bullish and bearish reversal patterns, as well as continuation patterns, can be used to identify potential price breakouts or reversals. By being able to accurately identify these patterns, traders can anticipate when it’s a good time to buy or sell yearn.finance.In summary, yearn.finance traders use a variety of indicators, chart patterns, and fundamental analysis to try and identify when it's a good time to buy or sell YFI. Moving averages, RSI and Fibonacci retracement levels, candlestick patterns, and monitoring ""whales"" are all popular tools that traders use to make yearn.finance price predictions."

A handful of independent pharmacies is suing Express Scripts for allegedly signing a three-year deal with pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics to fix reimbursement rates, a violation of the Sherman Act.

The lawsuit called the arrangement anticompetitive and unlawful. It alleges that the deal spurred both companies to charge a higher transaction fee rate to retail pharmacies, while they reimbursed at a lower rate.

Before the deal, the suit said, Prime Therapeutics collected lower fees from pharmacies and reimbursed them more than Express Scripts for dispensing drugs, but once the deal was completed, Prime charged the same transaction fees and reimbursed at the same level as Express Scripts.

The agreement, the lawsuit alleges, allows Prime to essentially ""borrow"" Express Scripts' considerable market power to lower reimbursement rates and impose higher transaction fees, resulting in higher profits.

Prime Therapeutics is not named as a defendant in the suit. Express Scripts is owned by Cigna.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

PBMs position themselves as intermediaries between drugmakers, pharmacies and health insurers to negotiate drug prices and maintain lists of insurance-covered drugs, or formularies.

The four independent pharmacies that brought the lawsuit – two in Wisconsin, and one apiece in New Jersey and Minnesota – allege that the partnership between Prime and Express Scripts served solely as a price-fixing mechanism and did not bring with it any new efficiencies.

Express Scripts covers about 100 million people in the U.S., with Prime covering about 33 million. The partnership materialized four years ago, when Express Scripts said it would handle rebate negotiations with drugmakers, as well as retail pharmacy network contracting for Prime.

Alleging that Express Scripts and Prime have not integrated any assets or business functions, it called the agreement between the two companies ""a naked restraint of trade.""

A spokesperson for Express Scripts said the lawsuit was without merit, adding that the company was committed ""to reimbursing network pharmacies fairly and will vigorously defend ourselves against the baseless allegations in this complaint.""

THE LARGER TREND

Claiming that its old policy statements no longer reflect current market dynamics, the Federal Trade Commission voted to rescind its prior statements of advocacy for pharmacy benefit managers in July, effectively ending the agency's previously stated endorsement of PBMs.

According to the FTC, the new statement pulling its advocacy is a response to PBMs' continued reliance on older FTC advocacy materials that opposed mandatory PBM transparency and disclosure requirements.

It also warns against reliance on the commission's prior conclusions, particularly given the FTC's ongoing study of the PBM industry to update its understanding of the industry and its practices.

A year ago, after the FTC first announced its study into PBM practices, a number of pharmaceutical groups came out in favor of the FTC inquiry. The American Pharmacy Cooperative said it had long advocated for federal oversight of PBMs.

In September, PhRMA released Nephron Research that contends PBMs are driving up profits and drug prices through fees. PBMs demand double the amount of fees today than they did five years ago, according to the report.

Congress has been investigating PBM practices. Earlier this year, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability said CVS Health's CVS Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts and United Health Group's Optum Rx control an estimated 80% of the PBM marketplace.

In Committee Republicans' December 2021 report, findings revealed that large PBM consolidation has negatively impacted patient health, increased costs for consumers, forced manufacturers to raise their prices, and created conflicts of interest which distort the market and limit high-quality care for patients, the committee said.

By Hugh T. Ferguson, NASFAA Senior Staff Reporter

The Department of Education (ED) on Tuesday released final rules on a number of topics that the department says will “raise the bar” on institutional accountability and better protect students and taxpayers.

The rules released Tuesday are the remaining accountability topics considered during the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility Committee: Ability to Benefit, Administrative Capability, Certification Procedures, and Financial Responsibility. The final rules will be published in the Federal Register, though ED has published an unofficial copy.

In a press call, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona stressed that the department’s actions underscore the Biden administration’s commitment to be equally as aggressive on student loan debt relief and accountability in higher education programs.

ED negotiated these regulations in a rulemaking session held in early 2022, where it also discussed institutional and programmatic eligibility topics including the 90/10 rule and the recently released gainful employment regulations.

“These rules give the department greater tools to protect taxpayers from losses created by school misconduct and closures, they allow the department to more quickly and effectively place conditions on some worrisome schools,” said Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “They ensure that when students take out loans for programs that lead to licensure they will be able to achieve their educational dreams.”

According to ED, Tuesday’s rules package will specifically help the department “better protect taxpayers from the negative effects of sudden college closures, will restrict colleges from withholding course credits paid for with federal money from students’ transcripts, and require colleges to clearly communicate to students how much financial aid they will receive.”

The first rule as a part of Tuesday’s announcement included standards of financial responsibility for postsecondary institutions, which outline certain mandatory triggering events that will result in requests for a letter of credit or other forms of financial protection.

Examples of those triggers would include when an institution is showing financial risk due to failure to meet debt obligations, certain lawsuits by federal or state actors, being in danger of losing access to federal student aid due to having a high cohort default rate, failing the 90/10 revenue requirement, or receiving at least 50% of the institution’s Title IV aid for failing gainful employment programs.

The rule also includes discretionary triggers that could result in a requirement to provide financial protection based upon a case-by-case determination. Those triggers include institutions: subject to adverse accreditor actions; experiencing significant fluctuations in federal student aid volume; closing programs or locations that enroll significant shares of students; subject to adverse actions by states and other federal agencies.

The package also concerned establishing Title IV student aid eligibility for individuals who lack a high school diploma or equivalent, commonly referred to as the ability to benefit (ATB) regulations.

According to ED, the final rule generally follows the proposed rule unveiled in May of this year. The final rule defines an eligible career pathway program (ECPP) and sets clear standards for institutions to demonstrate compliance. One significant change in the final rule is that ED “simplified” the process for approving ECPPs by focusing on approving at least one ECPP per institution.

Finally Tuesday’s announcement also included administrative capability and certification procedures, which add several requirements for colleges, including: more detailed information to be included in financial aid communications; prohibition of transcript withholding for courses paid for using federal funds; and adequate career services.

The rules would also enable ED to lay out additional conditions the department can place on institutions exhibiting financial warning signs by requiring a teach-out plan or agreement, or limit the addition of new programs and locations. Additionally, the rule would ensure that student aid is only made available for career-training programs that are no longer than state requirements for certification or licensure. The rule also touches on institutions operating through distance education and requires those schools to abide by state laws related to postsecondary closures including rules for teach-outs, record retention, and tuition recovery or surety bonds.

Since these final rules will be published in the Federal Register on October 31, 2023, they will go into effect July 1, 2024.

Stay tuned to Today’s News for a forthcoming deep dive article on these topics.

Dealer/Intermediary

These participants are what are typically described as the ""sell side"" of the market. Though they may not predominately sell futures, they do design and sell various financial assets to clients. They tend to have matched books or offset their risk across markets and clients. Futures contracts are part of the pricing and balancing of risk associated with the products they sell and their activities. These include large banks (U.S. and non-U.S.) and dealers in securities, swaps and other derivatives.

The rest of the market comprises the ""buy-side,"" which is divided into three separate categories:

Asset Manager/Institutional

These are institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and those portfolio/investment managers whose clients are predominantly institutional.

Leveraged Funds

These are typically hedge funds and various types of money managers, including registered commodity trading advisors (CTAs); registered commodity pool operators (CPOs) or unregistered funds identified by CFTC. The strategies may involve taking outright positions or arbitrage within and across markets. The traders may be engaged in managing and conducting proprietary futures trading and trading on behalf of speculative clients.

Other Reportables

Reportable traders that are not placed into one of the first three categories are placed into the ""other reportables"" category. The traders in this category mostly are using markets to hedge business risk, whether that risk is related to foreign exchange, equities or interest rates.

Loan Was Forgiven, Senate Inquiry Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/clarence-thomas-rv-loan-senate-inquiry.html,"The terms of the private loan were as generous as they were clear: With no money down, Justice Clarence Thomas could borrow more than a quarter of a million dollars from a wealthy friend to buy a 40-foot luxury motor coach, making annual interest-only payments for five years. Only then would the principal come due.

But despite the favorable nature of the 1999 loan and a lengthy extension to make good on his obligations, Justice Thomas failed to repay a “significant portion” — or perhaps any — of the $267,230 principal, according to a new report by Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee. Nearly nine years later, after Justice Thomas had made an unclear number of the interest payments, the outstanding debt was forgiven, an outcome with ethical and potential tax consequences for the justice.

“This was, in short, a sweetheart deal” that made no logical sense from a business perspective, Michael Hamersley, a tax lawyer who has served as a congressional expert witness, told The New York Times.

The Senate inquiry was prompted by a Times investigation published in August that revealed that Justice Thomas bought his Prevost Marathon Le Mirage XL, a brand favored by touring rock bands and the super-wealthy, with financing from Anthony Welters, a longtime friend who made his fortune in the health care industry."," The loan was reportedly very generous, and Justice Thomas failed to repay a ""significant portion"" of the principal, which was later forgiven."

Spending: 60% of leaders have allocated capital to GenAI technologies in the last year and 75% plan to increase spending over the coming year

Roles: 60% of leaders anticipate AI adoption will significantly affect entry-level roles, with 35% planning to incorporate AI training within graduate programs

Concerns: Leaders are most worried about the lack of understanding of GenAI in their workforce, future regulation, and ethical considerations

Leaders across Europe’s financial services sector expect Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies to deliver a windfall to productivity, according to the new EY European Financial Services AI Survey, which finds that 77% of respondents are bracing for a significant impact to their workforce and operations.

The survey, which canvassed the views of executives from 60 European financial institutions – including listed firms representing an aggregate market cap of £507.7bn – in October 2023, found that two-thirds (68%) of respondents anticipate that up to a quarter of all roles will require AI training or upskilling over the next six to 12 months, with 17% believing it could be as much as half.



However, action to realize productivity gains and workforce development through training and upskilling remains limited. More than a third of respondents (35%) said they currently have no plans in place to train their workforce in new and rapidly evolving GenAI technologies, while a further 42% described their plans as being “in their infancy”. Taking a more focused approach, 12% of leaders stated that they have training in place for targeted groups and just 10% reported having developed plans in use. Only 2% of respondents believe that their workforce is fully equipped to contribute end-to-end to building AI capabilities across their organization.



European finance leaders plan to increase capital allocation to Gen AI

The survey confirms that expenditure on GenAI is already widespread within Europe’s financial sector: over the past six to 12 months, nearly two-thirds of respondents (60%) said their firm has actively invested in the technology. Looking ahead, sector spending on integrating these technologies is set to rise over the near-term, with 75% of executives planning to increase spending over the next six to 12 months.

Ayman Awada, EY EMEIA Financial Services Technology Consulting Leader, comments: “Europe’s financial leaders are investing in AI technologies, targeting increased productivity, customer benefits and operational efficiencies. However, the challenge of enabling the workforce to realize and capitalize on potential gains requires in-depth, long-term planning, which is not yet in full force.

“GenAI technologies and the potential of their applications continue to evolve rapidly. Financial services leaders must ensure that they are adopting a strategic mindset as they manage their investment, both in new technologies and their people. Bringing together the best of human-driven insight, with the breadth of GenAI capabilities, will be fundamental to successful GenAI integration.”

The impact of AI on entry-level and graduate talent is in focus for banks, insurers, and asset managers; 60% of executives surveyed expect new technologies to have a significant impact on the roles and tasks undertaken by those joining the workforce. To manage the impact, 35% of executives said they plan to integrate AI training within their graduate program, while a quarter (25%) are planning a more widespread restructuring of roles and responsibilities across entry-level positions. Another 28%, however, said they have not taken any action to offset potential knock-on impacts.

When asked to consider the top attributes that firms will seek as they recruit entry level talent for a GenAI-enabled workforce, the traits most cited by European financial services leaders were an innovative and interdisciplinary mindset, followed by being tech savvy and experimental.



The area of expertise most in demand from skilled talent, specifically in reference to AI integration over the next two years, is data science and innovation (the top choice for 45% of executive respondents), followed by information and technology (24%) and operations (14%).

Omar Ali, EY EMEIA Financial Services Managing Partner, comments: “After more than three decades of major digital transformation across financial services, the rise of Generative AI is demanding yet another new set of skills for firms.

“Across Europe’s financial boardrooms, GenAI is prominent on every agenda. European financial services leaders are focused on developing the next generation of talent, for whom the use of innovative technologies in how they work and learn will become second nature. It is encouraging to see high levels of forward planning and development of graduate programs which are focused on building new skills that will be needed to compete both in market and internationally. While Europe’s boardrooms continue to assess the skills, expertise, and ethical considerations required to manage the risks and benefits of GenAI, steps to develop future, junior talent must also remain a priority.”

AI knowledge, future regulation, and ethics are leaders’ top concerns



When asked to consider the top concerns presented by GenAI integration, European financial services leaders were most likely to cite limited understanding and experience of GenAI applications and their impact across the workforce (36%), followed by uncertainty about existing and pending potential regulatory impacts (29%), and ethical issues around GenAI (7%).

Concerns around the ethics of GenAI are centred on privacy (cited by 32% of all respondents), followed by transparency and explainability (23%), and the potential for discrimination, bias, and lack of fairness (23%). To manage potential ethical implications arising from GenAI integration, nearly a fifth (18%) of respondents claimed they have already put an AI ethics framework in place, with a further 30% in the early stages of development. However, approaching half (45%) of respondents stated their firm is yet to develop an AI ethics framework.

In terms of accountability, half (50%) of respondents reported that their firm’s technology team will be responsible for the integration of AI across the business, reporting to the Chief Information Officer (or equivalent position). Nearly four in 10 (38%) respondents said their firm remains in the process of defining lines of accountability.

Ayman Awada, EY EMEIA Financial Services Technology Consulting Leader, comments: “GenAI technologies are changing operations, processes and customer experiences across the financial services sector, yet concerns around understanding, skills gaps, regulatory impacts and ethics remain prominent. Firms operating across multiple jurisdictions may also be considering the commercial and operational impacts of divergent regulatory regimes. Defining how organizations are going to approach, develop and integrate new capabilities across operations is a critical first step to ensuring that firms are well positioned to mitigate risks, while effectively harnessing the benefits afforded by GenAI.”

About the EY 2023 European Financial Services AI Survey

The EY European Financial Services AI Survey canvassed the views of 60 financial services firms (listed and private) across Europe to assess the potential impacts of AI integration on productivity, talent, skills and risk management, as well as plans for capital allocation and spending on GenAI technologies."," action yet.European financial sector leaders expect GenAI to significantly affect productivity, upskilling is seen as necessary for up to a quarter of all roles, and 60% expect a significant impact on entry-level roles. Despite this, 35% of respondents lack any action plans for training and upskilling. Over the past six to 12 months, 60% of executives said their firm has actively invested in GenAI technologies, with 75% planning to increase spending over the next six to 12 months."
2023-10-25T00:00:00.0000000,FBI had 40 informants tracking Biden family financial dealings ...,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/oct/25/fbi-had-40-informants-tracking-biden-family-financ/,"More than 40 confidential sources were providing information to the FBI about the Biden family and they produced credible evidence of corruption, the Senate’s most senior lawmaker said Wednesday.

But the allegations ran into resistance from biased officials at the FBI and Justice Department, who led an effort to hinder probes into President Biden, his brother James Biden and his son Hunter Biden, said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican.

The senator also said he has found out that the FBI had information as far back as October 2020 that contradicted then-candidate Joe Biden’s claims that he wasn’t aware of Hunter Biden’s business dealings.

That includes an FBI interview with a former Hunter Biden business partner who “provided first-hand knowledge as an eye and ear witness to Joe Biden’s involvement in potentially criminal schemes with Hunter Biden,” Mr. Grassley wrote in a letter demanding answers from Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Mr. Grassley suggested the FBI and Justice Department suffered from a “political infection” and said is rotting the two storied agencies from the inside.

“Based on the information provided to my office over a period of years by multiple credible whistleblowers, there appears to be an effort within the Justice Department and FBI to shut down investigative activity relating to the Biden family,” Mr. Grassley wrote.

“Such decisions point to significant political bias infecting the decision-making of not only the Attorney General and FBI Director, but also line agents and prosecutors. Our Republic cannot survive such a political infection and you have an obligation to this country to clear the air,” he added.

The White House has dismissed charges of the president benefitting from his son’s business dealings, repeating Mr. Biden’s insistence he didn’t know what Hunter was doing.

Mr. Grassley is the lawmaker who first revealed the full FBI record of accusations by a source that said Ukrainian gas company Burisma hired Hunter Biden to gain Biden family political protection from a corruption investigation inside Ukraine.

The source said Burisma’s CEO planned to make payments to both Hunter Biden and his father.

Mr. Grassley detailed an intricate process at the FBI of trying to validate the accusations, and a disturbing attempt to discredit the allegations by labeling them foreign disinformation.

He said a follow-up review by two U.S. attorneys’ offices found no indicators of known foreign disinformation, which makes the original disinformation claims all the more suspect.

“As such, it’s essential that we examine the alleged attempts by FBI personnel to sweep it under the rug,” the senator said.

Mr. Grassley said he wants to interview 25 FBI and Justice Department employees.

He also demanded to know how the FBI handled the information from its October 2020 interview with Hunter Biden’s business partner, as well as handling of other informants’ information.

One recent graduate's experience highlights why this may not be optimal.

A University of Manchester economics graduate, joined KPMG as an audit associate in four years ago. He worked there for just over a year, auditing investment banks.

The ex-audit associate left Grant Thornton because he was burnt out by his personal life. However, work may not have helped. A letter he received from the firm nearly 12 months said he'd been underpaid. After looking back through its timesheet data and considering his 'flexible benefit choices,' Grant Thornton said it had realised that he'd earned less than the minimum wage for the time he'd spent there. It sent him £100 for the inconvenience and promised to make up the difference.

The UK minimum wage is currently £10.42 ($12.64) an hour. The says he wasn't aggrieved at his underpayment, and instead complimented Grant Thornton for its honesty. He didn't respond to a request to comment for this article.

A spokesperson for Grant Thornton LLP said it had reviewed its internal data and found that ""a small number of our people were inadvertently paid under the National Minimum Wage threshold, owing to them having made significant salary sacrifice deductions via our flexible benefit choices and/or having worked longer hours during specific periods of the year."" It added that no one there actually receives a salary below the minimum wage threshold.

Grant Thornton is not the only accounting firm making use of graduate hires on very low hourly rates - PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte were recently fined by the Spanish government after graduate employees complained of earning €14k (£12k) a year while working 12-hour days six days a week.

Graduate jobs in the Big Four are usually seen as more secure than those in banks. However, Big firms are cutting recent hires in an effort to cut costs. The FT reported last week that Deloitte, for example, is removing 150 first and second year analysts from its consulting division.

That is where the financial ombud for the University of Kentucky, Nicholas Barnes, can come to the rescue — helping resolve students' financial situations.

UKNow caught up with Barnes to talk about what his role is and the impact an ombudsman can have on student success.

UKNow: What is a financial ombud and what is their role at a the university?

Barnes: The Financial Ombud Office provides guidance and assistance to students who have encountered financial difficulties after they have met with their UK financial aid counselor. The ombud works with students individually to assist in student financial challenges affecting scheduled payments for tuition and fees to the university.

UKNow: When would a student use the services of a financial ombud?

Barnes: A student who is considering withdrawing from UK due to financial problems that affect payment of their tuition, housing and dining fees should contact my office immediately.

UKNow: What were the reasons you decided to pursue the career of being a financial ombud?

Barnes: I knew once the position was available it would be a perfect fit for me. I have been working in financial aid for the past 13 years and have always had a passion for helping students achieve their goals in higher education. It is so rewarding being able to go home at night knowing that you helped someone in need.

UKNow: How does it feel knowing you are impacting a student's life and helping them reach their educational goals?

Barnes: It is the best feeling in the world when a student tells you that they truly appreciate your help.

UKNow: In your position, how important is it to build relationships with students, so they do decide to come to your office for help?

Barnes: I think it is very important to build a positive relationship with students so they feel comfortable coming to my office to discuss potential financial issues they may be having. It is important to me to make them feel like my office is a safe place to come and talk about everything that might be causing them financial stress.

2023-10-25T00:00:00.0000000,ICBA Statement on Federal Reserve Proposal on Debit Card Interchange,https://www.icba.org/newsroom/news-and-articles/2023/10/25/icba-statement-on-federal-reserve-proposal-on-debit-card-interchange,"Washington, D.C. (Oct. 25, 2023)—Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) President and CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey issued the following statement on today’s Federal Reserve Board proposal to update Regulation II rules on debit card interchange fees and routing.

“ICBA has deep concerns about the impact of today’s Federal Reserve proposed rule to reduce interchange rates at banks with at least $10 billion in assets, which would harm all community banks and the customers and communities they serve.

“As Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said today in voting against the proposal, the agency’s cap on debit card interchange puts smaller card issuers at a disadvantage due to their smaller transaction volumes and lower negotiating power relative to larger issuers, which could cut off access to low-cost and no-cost banking services in local communities — even those served by the community banks that are intended to be exempt from the proposal. The Fed’s 2021 study bears out those concerns, showing that low-volume issuers operate their debit card programs at a loss due to their disproportionately high authorization, clearing, and settlement costs, demonstrating that the Fed’s debit interchange caps are not “reasonable and proportional” as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

“Durbin Amendment price controls on debit card interchange have distorted the debit card and consumer checking markets solely to the benefit of big-box retailers, such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon. While the Durbin Amendment has severely diminished consumer access to debit rewards and free checking, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond data shows merchants have pocketed $12 billion per year in interchange fees without passing the savings along to customers.

“Government price controls on debit card interchange have caused significant economic harm to community banks and the communities they serve, and further expanding these policies would only compound that harm. ICBA looks forward to reviewing today’s proposal and urges the Fed to mitigate its negative impact on community banks and local communities.”

As machine and deep learning have evolved, so have their roles. They’re now also assisting in identity validation and risk assessment and helping providing personalized customer experiences.

Enter generative AI — a niche within deep learning. Having hit the mainstream in late 2022, this technology has the potential to reshape banking through its ability to generate content and engage in humanlike interactions.

Developing consumer-facing solutions like AI-driven financial advisors or conversational banking would take time, partly due to issues associated with integrating gen AI into existing systems and partly because of the need to make sure that using it doesn’t lead to data privacy and veracity challenges. Today, banks are eyeing generative AI for game-changing internal applications, including knowledge management, credit decisioning and cybersecurity.

Three key impact areas

Large banks tackling knowledge management initiatives — sharing relevant information within an organization — often must grapple with siloed data, a problem worsened by legacy or outdated tech. Generative AI can help by processing vast amounts of data and promptly delivering information to those who need it. The ability to dynamically synthesize data means faster access to regulations for legal teams, product documentation for engineers, and branding guidelines for marketers — all of which boost efficiency.

As for credit decisioning, traditional lending often suffers from slow processes and complexity — think of acquiring a home mortgage. Working with open banking methods and in concert with other AI models, generative AI can streamline this. It can help serve those without standard credit histories or with thin credit profiles by considering alternative data, synthesizing information for lenders, supporting decision-making and proposing lending strategies. Moreover, AI can guide applicants seamlessly through procedures, enhancing user experience.

In cybersecurity, gen AI trained on vast datasets, including malware and synthetic data, can predict cyber threats, simulate security scenarios and pinpoint anomalies — providing a richer, real-time defense strategy. Security teams can use the technology to create models predictive of cyberattacks and propose methods of countering them.

Difficulties to finesse

Generative AI isn’t without its challenges.

First, there’s the data exposure issue. Gen AI models ingest as training data the information to which they’re exposed, such as transaction or chat information, and then repurpose it. This is a concern in banking, where data security is paramount and compliance with privacy regulations is required.

Information accuracy is another concern. Generative AI can sometimes produce inaccurate or “hallucinated” information — a challenge for knowledge management.

Third, AI might perpetuate bias. If a data pool reflects that a certain demographic has historically received fewer loans, the AI application could take that fact as prescriptive and discriminate against that group. Understanding and mitigating this is crucial.

Finally, if gen AI can be a powerful cybersecurity tool, it’s also true that criminals can exploit it, using it to produce “deep fakes” or churn out iterations of deceptive email copy in phishing expeditions. Security specialists will have to come to terms with this tech’s two-sided nature and stay a step ahead of bad actors.

Implementing gen AI safely

Financial institutions could build their own models to mitigate risks of various sorts, ensuring control over them — for example, by restricting their use to select clients or making them purely internal solutions so that the data security stakes are lower.

Banks might also adapt commercially available models for their specific needs, ensuring tighter controls. Opting for commercially available models can also be cost-effective for many institutions. (Well-known financial institutions have recently used or are using these strategies.)

The takeaway? “Restricted” is the watchword for many financial entities. The focus is on secure, regulated and in-house applications.

Starting small and ramping up

Don’t expect a complete gen AI overhaul of enterprise tech overnight. Generative AI will likely integrate gradually into banking, starting small with internal use cases and, as challenges are addressed, expanding toward more ambitious and public-facing deployments. But given its potential, it’s poised to deliver a significant transformation in bank operations over the next several years.

Look for a comprehensive exploration of generative AI’s role in banking in the next issue of Mastercard Signals.","shrouding them in a custom-made, secure environment.Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize banking, but banks must first address the tech’s challenges and ensure the safety and accuracy of their data.Generative AI has hit the mainstream, and has the potential to revolutionize banking by aiding in identity validation, risk assessment, knowledge management, credit decisioning, and cybersecurity.

I recently had a repossession and called to get more information regarding it. I was told the amount I needed to produce to return my car. I paid that amount on 9.09.2023. I had to drive to SC to get the car. The next day I called Westlake to see what was next and if I needed to do anything else. I was told that I needed to contact West Direct since I was almost done paying for the car. My car was repossessed for a month. So, I called west direct and spoke with a respectful gentleman that explained that I had 5 more payments left and by the 5th payment to call in and they will put me a on plan to purchase the car. I only had the car two weeks and last Tuesday and I go outside, and my car was gone.

I called Westlake and a rep told me they took the car because they didn't receive a “letter stating the finance balance"" wasn’t sent over and once that’s sent over, I can go pick up the car. I called West Direct for 3 days straight and got transferred over 8 times. The person who accepted my phone call said that I needed that letter first. So, I call Westlake back explaining that. I’m on hold for a long time. The guy comes back to the phone this morning and tells me that his supervisor is sending the letter over to the repo place for me to get the car. I called the repo place, and they haven't received anything.

Nobody from Westlake or West Direct or my contract says that I need a lump sum of money to get my car back. I was told I had to make my 5 payments and then they would put me on a plan to begin purchasing the car. I have spoken with so many people that have given me incorrect information or finding out stuff nobody ever told me. I am devastated that no one wants to fix the problem. I never knew anything about them taking the car after the maturity date. I found that out the other day as well. I don’t know what to do. All I have done was follow either what was emailed to me or what was told to me by representatives. I now don’t have transportation and I’m trying to get this handled.

I just called back today, and the lady rep tells me I need to pay 2500 to get the car back or pay 450 for repo fees and I can get the car back, but it can still be repossessed. I've never heard of anything like this in my life. Everyone I speak wants to transfer me or hang up the call. I’m finding out so much information that I can’t seem to find in my contract. Ever since the bankrupt all of this has been horrible. All I'm needed is a financial balance lease to keep the car. I feel nobody wants to help. They want to keep the car after receiving thousands of dollars from me and left with misinformation and no car. This is ridiculous and has my blood pressure through the roof. I would not recommend going through them for a car. It has been hell.","A man recently had his car repossessed after paying the amount asked. He had been told he needed to contact West Direct to complete payment for the car, but when he called Westlake and West Direct for more information, they kept transferring him and giving him incorrect information. Despite all of his payments, he has been told that he must pay 2500 to get the car back or face repossession again. No one from either company has been helpful in resolving the issue, leaving him with no transportation and feeling like nobody is willing to help."

Jason, 35, and his teammate Landon Dickerson rode up to the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Sunday, October 22, in a “sick” vintage Mustang. “Landon drives me to the game quite frequently,” Jason told younger brother Travis Kelce on the Wednesday, October 25, episode of their “New Heights” podcast, explaining that Kylie, 31, often “drives herself” to her husband’s home games.

“Then we drive back home together after the game,” Jason added. “Normally we’re in [Landon’s] truck.”

Kylie attended the team’s Sunday game against the Miami Dolphins, revealing via her Instagram Story on Tuesday, October 24, that she sat beside her mother-in-law, Donna Kelce, who “came through with the game day [snacks].”

Related: Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce's Relationship Timeline Jason Kelce swiped right and found love with Kylie McDevitt — even if their first date got off to a rocky start. “[I] definitely fell asleep,” the Philadelphia Eagles athlete recalled on his “New Heights” podcast in September 2023. “Got a little too inebriated, but I was sober enough to know it was the most […]

The couple — who have been married since 2018 and share three daughters — were recently featured in the Prime Video documentary Kelce, giving fans a glimpse of their lives at home ahead of Super Bowl LVII. (Kylie was 38 weeks pregnant with the pair’s third baby at the time and brought her doctor along to the championship game in case she went into labor.)

While promoting the film earlier this month, Kylie opened up about her unique lifestyle as the wife of a pro football player. “I think there is a population of women who are married to, dating, engaged to individuals who play in the NFL or other professional sports that really, like, enjoy indulging in the finer things in life and that’s not necessarily how I was raised or what I enjoy,” she told Today in a joint interview with Jason. “So I think that staying authentic to that [is important].”

Related: Travis Kelce's Cutest Moments With His Nieces: Family Photos Jason Kelce’s daughters famously didn’t want Travis to win the 2022 Super Bowl, but the girls still love their “Uncle Travy.” Travis Kelce isn’t a father, just yet, but he’s definitely a model uncle to brother Jason Kelce and sister-in-law Kylie Kelce’s three daughters — Wyatt Elizabeth born in October 2019, Elliotte Ray born in […]

The spotlight has been on the Kelce family even more lately thanks to Travis, 34, and his budding romance with Taylor Swift. Since September, the 33-year-old pop star has attended four Kansas City Chiefs games, supporting Travis and his team from a private suite in the stadium. Swift has bonded with both Donna and Ed Kelce — but it’s unlikely she’ll be sitting with Kylie when the Eagles take on the Chiefs in November.

“I think that Kylie’s going to have seats right down where the actual team is,” Donna predicted on the “Got It From My Mama” podcast on October 6. “So, she’ll probably be right behind the team and I would imagine she’ll have some of the other moms with her.”

Related: Kylie Kelce Isn’t Your Typical NFL Spouse: What She’s Said Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie Kelce, is his — and the Philadelphia Eagles’ — No. 1 cheerleader. “I am like an Eagles fan to the extent of, like, if Jason ever went and played for another team, I would wear ‘Kelce,’ I would not wear another team’s stuff,” Kylie quipped in Jason’s Kelce documentary, which premiered […]

She continued: “I don’t think she’s gonna be bringing the kids, but everybody [who] is rooting for Kansas City will be up in the suites. … I don’t blame her [if] she wouldn’t want to be in the suite.”

Kylie is a quiet — but fierce — supporter of her husband both on and off the field. She recently helped convince Jason to join her and Travis for the first game of the 2023 NLCS playoffs to cheer for the Philadelphia Phillies one day after a tough Eagles loss to the New York Jets.

A decade ago, Mercy took a significant step by installing Bloomberg Terminals, marking a natural evolution for its thriving School of Business. This strategic decision underlined Mercy's commitment to preparing its graduates for rewarding careers by harnessing the power of a cutting-edge software system.

Bloomberg Terminals provide real-time financial market data analysis. With licenses made available to students at Mercy, they gain access to an industry-leading resource. The terminals, coupled with ticker tape displays adorning the walls of Mercy's Westchester and Manhattan Campuses, create an immersive Wall Street atmosphere, familiar to global financiers and appealing to users and passersby.

Heather Apollonio, M.B.A. '23, Mercy’s director of advancement operations and prospect management, highlights the capabilities of Bloomberg Terminals – which became apparent to her while working toward a graduate degree at Mercy: ""The terminals provide not just stock data but a tremendous wealth of business information. Students can map supply chains, extract diverse data related to brand value, gauge media perceptions of different brands, and correlate this data with stock performance.""

The installation of Bloomberg Terminals at Mercy University was made possible through the generosity of several donors. It reflects Mercy's ongoing investment in its students and belief in their potential. Joseph P. Carlucci, a Mercy University Trustee and Bloomberg Terminal donor, recognizes the importance of Bloomberg Terminals in the financial services industry, stating, ""Investing in Bloomberg terminals is a significant step towards graduating work-ready students.""

In recent years, Lloyd Gibson, dean of the School of Business, has been instrumental in enhancing students' engagement with Bloomberg Terminals. He, along with Williams and other business faculty, has implemented various initiatives. These include enrolling students in the annual global Bloomberg Trading Challenge, integrating Bloomberg Terminal usage into course curricula, promoting their use in student and faculty research, encouraging completion of the Bloomberg market concept certification, and conducting training seminars for students and alumni.

The Bloomberg Trading Challenge, an investment competition for both undergraduate and graduate students, unfolds entirely within the Bloomberg Terminal. Mercy students form small teams and invest a virtual sum of $1 million to construct a portfolio that outperforms the Bloomberg World Large, Mid & Small Cap index. In 2021, Mercy students excelled in this challenge, with the top-performing team securing the third spot in North America and the seventh spot globally, competing against teams from 496 countries.

Participating in the Challenge can be transformative, as Apollonio experienced as a graduate student new to the field of finance. ""The Bloomberg Trading Challenge made me absolutely fascinated with understanding how finance works — both the patterns and the driving forces behind them,"" she reflected.

Williams notes, ""Every day of the challenge, students gain a deeper understanding of finance and are compelled to make tough decisions. They learn to navigate the highs and lows, refining their skills, and, by the end of the Challenge, they realize they can do what they observe on platforms like CNBC.""

Mercy ensures that the knowledge and understanding of Bloomberg Terminals extend to the classroom, enhancing the course material. When professors reference real-world financial data, they incorporate Bloomberg Terminal capabilities, providing students with a dynamic learning experience.

In addition to classroom integration and the Trading Challenge, students also benefit from field trips to Bloomberg’s global headquarters in Manhattan. These field trips offer students a glimpse into the potential of their careers and enrich their understanding of the finance industry.

Moreover, the Bloomberg Terminals are an indispensable tool for supporting ongoing research efforts. For example, Williams and Apollonio researched the challenges associated with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings. ESG investing has gained immense popularity in recent years, but concerns have arisen regarding the reliability of current ESG rating methodologies. Williams and Apollonio contend that a positive ESG rating does not necessarily correlate with a company's financial performance and that it's challenging to assess the relevance of ESG rating components across various industries.

Williams emphasizes the significance of their research: ""Our work aims to enhance the understanding of ESG ratings for investors, given that ESG investments have reached $35.3 trillion, representing 35.9% of all professionally managed assets, as per the Global Sustainable Investment Review.""

The School of Business at Mercy University further enhances students' employability by offering the Bloomberg Market Concept Certification. This program, embedded in the undergraduate curriculum by Gibson and School of Business Assistant Professor Abdel-Kader Ben-Mohamed in 2019, equips students with valuable skills. To ensure ongoing proficiency, Mercy students and alumni can attend an annual training seminar conducted by Williams and a Bloomberg representative.

“These initiatives enable students to leverage Bloomberg Terminal data strategically, fostering critical decision-making skills in an information-driven world,” said Carlucci.

Kuwait City, 25 Oct: Kuwait Finance House “KFH” continues efforts to support “Diraya” financial and banking awareness campaign launched by the Central Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Banking Association for the second year in a row. The campaign aims to shed light on customers’ rights, rules and regulations of dealing with banks, information safety and security against intrusion, combating fraud transactions in addition to other warnings and regulations. This campaign comes as part of the bank’s obligation to keep the customers informed about their rights and duties regarding banking and financial transactions and their cyber security.

The campaign discusses finance types, banking cards, awareness of customers with special needs, tips on cyber security and protection of bank accounts. Also, it provides the mechanism to lodge complaints, protect customers’ rights and identify the banking sector duties and its role in enhancing and developing the national economy.

KFH contribution in the campaign comprises the dispatch of various messages on different topics related to the main components of the campaign. These messages are sent to all types of customers to suite the culture and nature of each tier. Also, messages are sent on continuous basis to employees who are considered as the second main component in the awareness triangle (customers – employees – public) who are either potential or targeted customers, thus aiming to achieve the targets of the campaign. The main targets of the campaign comprise awareness, identification of and warning against any possible risks of failing to follow safety and security instructions upon using modern technology means. Regulations include refraining from extending any information about accounts and personal transactions to any unknown parties or replying to messages from unknown sources as this would be a violation to data privacy and banking protection regulations.

KFH is keen on spreading financial education, saving and investment knowledge and customer awareness of the bank’s products and services. KFH appreciates the efforts extended by the Central Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Banking Association in organizing the Be Aware “Diraya” campaign to spread awareness in society regarding banking and financial transactions and e-banking services. Technology has opened vast business opportunities. However, several risks and challenges were also detected considering the several attempts, most of which failed, to hack customers’ accounts and cause system damage. Accordingly, this situation has called for a comprehensive awareness plan and enhancement of the cyber security systems, anti-money laundering systems and prevention of other legally incriminated and suspicious activities.

KFH messages highlight the clear and defined policies placed by the Central Bank of Kuwait to supervise the lending and finance operations at banks. These policies provide that the customer shall be provided with the loan details, value and No. of instalments, settlement dates, instalment/ net salary ratio and default penalties. The customer is given at least 2 days grace period to review the contract fully before signing. Once signed, a draft copy of the contract shall be given to the customer including type of loan, payment term, instalment value and profit. There are two types of loans offered to customers, consumer loan and residential loan.

According to CBK instructions, the bank is required to provide financial advice and all information concerning the finance contract and explain all details related to the finance transaction including rate of return/ finance amount, No. of installments to be paid by customer and components of each instalment before signing the contract with the customer. Customers shall be given two days period to review the contract and read the terms and conditions carefully and be aware of their rights and obligations before signing the contract.

Documents Show Businessman Forgave the Loan, which Thomas used to Purchase a Luxury RV

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today made public new information raising questions about whether Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas properly reported up to $267,230 in loan forgiveness on his tax filings.

According to information committee staff obtained through documents provided by Anthony Welters, who loaned Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas $267,230, Thomas made interest payments, but never repaid a substantial portion of the loan. As the New York Times first reported in August 2023, Thomas used the loan to purchase a luxury Prevost Marathon motor coach.

“Today the committee has the answer to one of the pressing questions raised by reporting about his arrangement with Justice Thomas - was the loan ever repaid? Now we know that Justice Thomas had up to $267,230 in debt forgiven and never reported it on his ethics forms,” Wyden said. “Regular Americans don’t get wealthy friends to forgive huge amounts of debt so they can buy a second home. Justice Thomas should inform the committee exactly how much debt was forgiven and whether he properly reported the loan forgiveness on his tax returns and paid all taxes owed. I have also directed the committee to share our findings with the Judiciary Committee to evaluate the ethics implications of this disclosure.”

Committee staff provided a memorandum to Chairman Wyden laying out their findings, including:

-A handwritten note from Justice Thomas, on Supreme Court stationery, dated December 6, 1999, referencing a promissory note and security agreement between Thomas and Mr. Welters

-A promissory note dated December 6, 1999, laying out terms between Clarence and Virginia Thomas and Mr. Welters, for a $267,230 loan, at 7.5 percent interest

-A security agreement dated December 6, 1999, between the Thomases and Mr. Welters, granting Mr. Welters a security interest in a 1991 Prevost RV to secure payment of the loan

-A bank check from Justice Thomas to Mr. Welters, dated December 21, 2000, for a motorcoach payment, for $20,042.23, the same amount as the annual 7.5% interest payment on a $267,230 loan, and

-A handwritten note from Mr. Welters to Justice Thomas, dated November 22, 2008, stating that Welters would no longer seek further payments on the loan. This note also stated that Justice Thomas had paid interest only on the loan, indicating that the principal of $267,230 had not been repaid by Justice Thomas.

-None of the documents reviewed by Committee staff indicated that Thomas ever made payments to Welters in excess of the annual interest on the loan.

The full memorandum on the committee’s investigation is available here.

Iberdrola installs Spain's largest solar community that will enable 1,100 families to reduce their bills

Iberdrola has installed the largest solar community in Spain at the Nexum Retail Park, located in Fuenlabrada (Madrid). This form of self-consumption will allow 1,100 families living within a maximum of two kilometres of the centre to access 100% renewable energy and save up to 40% of their consumption without the need for their own installation or investment.

Iberdrola has developed the Nexum Retail Park project as a cross-cutting initiative that contributes to decarbonisation in three areas of action: The generation of local renewable energy through self-consumption, the contribution to electric mobility with the installation of charging points, and the design of an innovative electrical installation designed to achieve maximum efficiency.

The solar community is made up of 1,350 panels located on three of the roofs of the business park, which have a combined power of 735 kilowatts, enough to produce more than one million kWh per year. The photovoltaic installation will prevent the emission of 6,000 tonnes of CO 2 into the atmosphere over the next 30 years.

In this form of self-consumption, Iberdrola is the one making the investment in order to enable local renewable consumption as a means to achieve the energy transition and decarbonisation of the economy. Any resident of Fuenlabrada, located less than 2 km from the installation, can benefit from the initiative through the company's website.

With the aim of decarbonising mobility and accelerating the development of electric mobility in Spain, the project also integrates an electric station that includes 8 semi-fast recharging stations and 5 ultra-fast chargers, which will enable the simultaneous charging of up to 26 vehicles. The users of the 13 double charging points will recharge their car batteries with 100% green energy from renewable generation.

In addition, the electrical installation, also designed by Iberdrola, will allow real-time monitoring of the shopping centre's electricity supply. In this way, and thanks to advanced data analytics, it will be possible to anticipate anomalies, detect opportunities for savings, monitor the decarbonisation plan and always maintain the maximum level of efficiency in the supply, which in turn will reduce the bill.

""The Nexum Retail Park shopping centre has allowed us to create a pioneering project based on electrification as the best tool for decarbonisation. At Iberdrola, we promote and facilitate the development of these projects in collaboration with our customers and for the benefit of society, fostering the energy transition and the fight against climate change"", says Luis Buil, Director of Smart Solutions at Iberdrola.

""We are very pleased to inaugurate this new retail park in Fuenlabrada on 8 November. A convenience retail park, a good neighbour that will make life easier for the people of Fuenlabrada in many ways, with its leading brands, its 700 free parking spaces and, of course, thanks to the collaboration with Iberdrola, providing the resident community with a state-of-the-art sustainable infrastructure"", says Joel Franco, head of the Retail Park project.

Straight out of campus, the man known as The Duke of Emali quickly rose through the corporate ladder to amass a fortune until everything came crashing down in shambles

Among the things the man owned were three expensive cars and a mansion before his experienced a downturn

Richard Kioko Kiundi, popularly known as “The Duke of Emali”, rose from a young man fresh from university to a high-flying accountant.

With money rolling in, the man from Makueni County led a lavish lifestyle that took him beyond the borders.

Got well-paying job at Toyota Kenya

In an interview with Afrimax English, Kioko disclosed that life started in the civil service, where he served the country in different roles before landing a job that changed his life.

It all began when the career accountant was having a beer and bumped into a gentleman who offered him four times the salary he had been earning.

""I was earning about KSh 4,500 then, so I quoted KSh 18,000, and the man told me to report to the Toyota Kenya office at the Nyayo Stadium roundabout,"" he recalled.

Kioko quickly rose through the ranks at Toyota and was soon promoted to Operations Manager before resigning to join Kenya Pipeline.

Owned lavish house, 3 cars

He was earning enough money to afford a magnificent house, own three cars, and take his four children to prestigious schools.

However, everything he had built started crumbling in 2013 when he was informed that he had a mild stroke and was admitted to HDU.

Kioko was treated and discharged; however, a few months later, he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour in his stomach.

""I was told I was the luckiest person on earth because stomach cancer is not easy to detect until it is too late,"" he continued.

It happened that he had resigned to start a company he was forced to sell.

With no income and the treatment gobbling all his money, Kioko soon fell behind on his financial obligations.

""I got into debt, which I could not pay, and they kept on growing, which caused me more stress,"" he said.

Through the Wilderness of Life

Having gone through a difficult period and gotten back to health, he wrote a book titled Through the Wilderness of Life, which details the life lessons he had picked.

Photos in the book show the different countries Kioko visited during his heyday and the prominent personalities he interacted with.

Kioko maintains that he may not be as wealthy as before, but he has found fulfilment in selling books on the streets of Kenya.

Man returned from abroad broke

Meanwhile, Legit.ng earlier reported that a Nigerian man in his mid-50s who spent more than a decade abroad returned to the country broke after people drained his savings.

In a TikTok clip, the man, who has lived in places like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon and some Asian countries, said he was making about N3m monthly working abroad.

When completed, the projects are anticipated to generate enough electricity to power more than 2.5 million homes, deliver 12% of New York’s energy needs, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 9.4 million metric tons annually.

The new awards also bring New York’s operating, contracted, and under development renewable energy projects to a capacity sufficient to supply 79% of the state’s electricity needs by 2030, well ahead of its mandatory goal to have 70% of electricity provided by renewable sources by that time. The projects will also contribute to the state’s path to achieve a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century.

Governor Hochul said:

“Today, we are taking action to keep New York’s climate goals within reach, demonstrating to the nation how to recalibrate in the wake of global economic challenges while driving us toward a greener and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

Roughly two-thirds of the awards were made to three large-scale offshore wind projects, including TotalEnergies, Rise Light & Power and Corio Generation’s 1.4 GW “Attentive Energy One,” RWE Offshore Renewables and National Grid Ventures’ 1.3 GW “Community Offshore Wind,” and Copenhagen Infrastructure’s Vineyard Offshore’s 1.3 GW “Excelsior Wind” project. Combined, the projects mark the largest-ever state investment in offshore wind, and are expected to displace more than 7 million tons of CO2 annually, and drive more than $15 billion in anticipated in-state spending.

The land-based awards include 14 new solar projects, six wind repowering projects, one new wind project, and a return-to-service hydroelectric project, totaling 2.4 GW. The projects are expected to spur more than $4 billion in direct investments.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said:","“New York’s visionary investment in renewable energy will create jobs and spur economic growth while reducing emissions and helping the state reach its clean energy goals.”New York Governor Kathy Hochul has announced the largest-ever U.S. state investment in renewable energy, with over 6.4 GW of projects awarded. These projects will power over 2.5 million homes, deliver 12% of New York's energy needs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 9.4 million metric tons annually. The projects will also help the state reach its goal of 70% renewable energy by 2030 and a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040."

The global survey, which also covered the local market, found that Australian SMEs are moving away from traditional banks, including the big four, at twice the rate of the global average.

Nearly one out of five (19 per cent) of local small businesses are accessing financial services through on-demand software platforms, often provided by fintech companies. This compares to fewer than one in 10 (9 per cent) of SME firms globally doing the same.

Further, 71 per cent of Australian SMEs stated that they were ready to switch their banking solution provider for a like-for-like alternative from their software provider – among which include services for cross-border payments collection and payouts, business bank accounts, foreign exchange, and treasury.

A particular bane for Australian SMEs was the lengthy processing and settlement times for payments provided through traditional players.

More than half (52 per cent) of Australian respondents said they faced a number of inefficiencies, including lengthy processing and settlement times, when receiving payments from abroad.

Further, 58 per cent of local small businesses also expressed their dissatisfaction with delays in paying out funds to vendors, suppliers and employees, including hold-ups in processing and disbursing payments. This was 13 percentage points higher than the international average of 45 per cent.

Forced currency conversion leading to high transaction fees was also cited by 41 per cent of respondents globally as a key concern.

Australian businesses, now well accustomed to dealing with fintechs, also appear more confident in financial software platforms than their global counterparts.

More than three-quarters (76 per cent) of surveyed Australian SMEs said that software platforms that offer integrated financial products are well equipped to service their needs, compared to two-thirds (64 per cent) of respondents globally.

Nearly two in three Australian small businesses (66 per cent) expressed an interest in accessing financial services through their existing software providers. While this appetite for change was found to be lower than for counterparts in China ( at 93 per cent) and the US (at 88 per cent), the survey said this was due to the relatively high number of SMEs (around 19 per cent) in Australia already leveraging software providers for these services – the highest of any regions within the study.

“That means Aussie [small and medium businesses] trust financial services like lending, payment processing or insurance that are embedded into nonfinancial businesses’ websites, without needing to be redirected to traditional financial institutions,” Airwallex said.

On average, globally, the report also found that in the majority of cases (76 per cent), SMEs would be prepared to pay more to work with a one-stop-shop provider that can support their financial and other needs as they grow their international business.

“The research highlights that [SMEs] are in search of streamlined solutions tailored to the specific needs of their industry, which is something that vertical software providers would be well-placed to offer,” Airwallex wrote in its report.

“The findings demonstrate a clear opportunity for software platforms or marketplaces such as eCommerce, customer relationship management (CRM,) or expense management platforms to better serve [SME] customers, and create new revenue streams by offering embedded financial services – particularly when it comes to global money movement and payments.”

Commenting on the results of the survey, Luke Latham, ANZ managing director at Airwallex, slammed the dominance of the big banks, which he said has led to a business banking system “that rips off small businesses and their customers”.

“Our research is clear – Aussie small businesses have had enough and are rejecting the big banks. One in five have already moved away, and the remainder are well on their way.

“The complacency of the big banks to build a model fit for their customers needs and the steep rise of alternative banking providers, means they’re scrambling to adapt their legacy systems to compete.”

Fintechs, Latham added, “are lightyears ahead of them in providing transparent, nimble and cost-effective banking solutions”.

“Banking may have been one of the more insulated industries against disruption from the digital age, no more. Innovative finance players, both home-grown and international, are entering the Australian market every month.”","ctor of Airwallex, said: “[SMEs] are increasingly comfortable with the idea of a one-stop shop when it comes to managing their finances.”A global survey of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) found that Australian SMEs are twice as likely as the global average to access financial services through on-demand software platforms, and 71% are ready to switch away from traditional banks for similar services. Additionally, 58% are dissatisfied with delays in paying out funds, and 76% would be willing to pay more for a one-stop-shop provider to better support their needs."

2023-10-25T00:00:00.0000000,Good news for take-home pay in South Africa – BusinessTech,https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/727130/good-news-for-take-home-pay-in-south-africa/,"Nominal take-home pay has grown as the operating conditions for the private sector improved.

According to the latest BankservAfrica Take-home Pay Index (BTPI) for September, nominal take-home showed monthly and annual growth for the third month in a row.

“The nominal take-home pay of R15,673 in September was a marginal growth on the R15,605 recorded in August and 4.1% higher than the R15,056 in September 2022,” said Shergeran Naidoo, BankservAfrica’s Head of Stakeholder Engagements.

The BTPI improved by 6.8% from the R14,623 in Q2 and the R15,610 in Q3, indicating that 2023 could be a better year for salaries than 2022.

“While the ability for companies to pay inflation-related salary increases was hampered in the past 18 months, especially by a rising operating cost environment, industries have generally become more resilient to the effects of load shedding,” said Elize Kruger, Independent Economist.

“If sustained, the somewhat better conditions in the private sector could provide better employment and remuneration prospects in the coming months.”

Source: BankservAfrica

In somewhat negative news, the average real take-home pay dropped after two months of growth – declining from R14,278 in August to R14,239 and dropping 0.8% compared to the previous year.

The slight drop was due to headline inflation rising sharply from 4.8% in August to 5.4% in September, driven by higher fuel prices.

Although fuel prices are expected to decline sharply in November, headline inflation is expected to stay between 5.0% and 5.7% for the next year.

Consumer inflation is, however, expected to decline from 6.9% in 2022 to 6.0% in 2023, with further moderation to 5.3% in 2024.

BankservAfrica said that interest rates have likely plateaued but noted that they could remain elevated for a while due to the upside inflation risks due to Rand’s weakness and higher fuel prices.

“With household finances already under severe pressure, this scenario remains negative for the spending ability and confidence levels of consumers,” said Kruger.

In another boost, data on weekly payments shows a slight pick up in the job market in Q3.

The BankservAfrica sample – representing roughly 25% of the labour market, saw 75,000 more salaries paid over the quarter.

This can build on the 39,000 jobs that were created in the non-agricultural formal sector in Q2 as per Stats SA’s Quarterly Employment Survey and the 154,000 more people employed in the formal, informal, agricultural and household sectors in the statistics body’s Labour Force Survey.

“While each new job opportunity should be celebrated, the stark reality is that South Africa’s population growth far exceeds its economic or job growths over the past number of years. As such, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high (32.6% in Q2),” said Kruger.

The BankservAfrica Private Pensions Index (BPPI) dropped slightly in nominal and real terms in both August and September, but it remains in positive territory on an annual basis.

“The average nominal private pension fell marginally to R10 758 in September compared to the previous month’s R10 780. It remains a healthy 8.7% higher than one year earlier,” said Naidoo.

The average private pension reached R9,727 in real terms, which was 3.2% higher than a year earlier. This shows that the purchasing power of pensions of those in the BankservAfrica database remained strong despite the high inflation environment.

2023-10-25T00:00:00.0000000,BMW Group Logistik successfully tests electric semi-trailer in various ...,https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/bmw-group-logistik-successfully-tests-electric-semi-trailer-in-various-scenarios-from-real-world-logistics-operations/,"Fuel saving of around 48 percent in combination with diesel trucks

BMW Group Logistik, in collaboration with the technology innovator Trailer Dynamics, has successfully tested an electrically powered semi-trailer on various tracks and over varying distances in real-world logistics operations. With the diesel truck used, average fuel savings of more than 46 percent over short and medium distances, and more than 48 percent over long distances, were attained. Using a combination of electric tractor and e-trailer, a range of more than 600 kilometres without recharging was achieved. There were four days of pilot tests over short and medium distances around the BMW Group location at Dingolfing, and three days of testing over long distances between Mamming in Lower Bavaria and the BMW Group plant in Leipzig. The capabilities of Trailer Dynamics’ e-trailer were put to the test to identify the best application scenarios for BMW Group Logistik.

“As the BMW Group, we are – as the first German car manufacturer – a member of the ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C’ of the Science-Based Targets Initiative and are committed to the target of complete climate neutrality throughout the entire value chain. Therefore, we are using visionary projects to consistently accelerate the BMW Group’s Green Transport Logistics strategy. The pilot testing with Trailer Dynamics’ e-trailer showed that using this kind of electrified semi-trailer significantly reduces the fuel consumption of standard diesel tractors and noticeably increases the range of e-trucks,” said Michael Nikolaides, Head of BMW Group Production Network and Logistics.

Semi-trailer with electric drive axle.

Unlike a conventional semi-trailer, the e-trailer from Trailer Dynamics of Eschweiler near Aachen is fitted with its own battery and electric drive axle. This axle supports the semi-trailer truck’s engine. Integrated sensors on the kingpin between the tractor and the trailer ensure an optimum load ratio and thus the best-possible fuel economy. As well as reducing the tractor’s energy consumption, the e-trailer’s powered axle also provides additional power during start-up and on slopes. In combination with a diesel truck, security of supply is also ensured even if the battery of the e‑trailer is empty.

The tests over a medium distance took place over four consecutive days on real logistics routes around the BMW Group location of Dingolfing. The round trip transportations with demanding route topographies were carried out with the logistics service provider Gahr International. Up to 250 kilometres were covered per day on motorways and main roads, with automated and simultaneous data collection from the e-trailer and tractor being performed for the first time. That showed an average reduction in diesel consumption of 46.59 percent.

Even greater fuel savings over long distances.

The long distance tests were also performed on real logistics routes and with a load of more than 16 tonnes between Leipzig and Mamming. Energy modules for BMW electric cars were transported over a distance of 450 kilometres with mainly on motorways. Compared with journeys with a conventional trailer and identical load, this resulted in diesel savings of more than 48 percent on average. The e-trailer’s battery was charged carbon neutrally using 100 percent green energy, meaning that with series application, a single electric trailer could facilitate a CO 2 reduction of around 120 tonnes per year (“Well to Wheel”).

100 percent CO 2 reduction when used with an e-truck.

A 100 percent reduction in CO 2 while simultaneously enabling long-distance routes can be achieved by combining an e-trailer with an electric tractor and 100 percent green electricity. This scenario was tested on the final day of medium-distance testing in the Dingolfing area using a Volvo e‑truck. With a normal load, a driving distance of more than 600 kilometres was achieved without recharging.

The fuel savings when using e-trailers are counterbalanced by their heavier weight and the resulting lower payload, but this is partially offset by an increase in the permissible total weight for trailers in the EU. The higher acquisition costs of the e-trailer are counteracted by lower operating costs. Over long distances in particular, the use of e-trailers can facilitate a significant decarbonisation of the existing fleet while simultaneously saving costs.

Trailer Dynamics’ vision is to make a significant contribution to decarbonising the economy with e-trailers and to promote sustainable, and ideally zero-emission, logistics. With our partner BMW and the forwarding agents Gahr International and Elflein Spedition & Transport, with these test drives we are taking the next important step in making our vision a reality,” said Abdullah Jaber, CEO and Managing Director Trailer Dynamics GmbH.

With the visionary e-trailer pilot projects, the BMW Group is accelerating the systematic implementation of their ‘Green Transport Logistics’ strategy. This cross-sector strategy is an integral element of the BMW iFACTORY. “It is important to us to support the development of innovative technologies in transport logistics. Establishing innovations like these helps our logistics partners and us to reduce CO₂ emissions and improve the overall footprint,” explained Michael Nikolaides.

Regardless of what the Premier League are 'recommending' in Everton’s Financial Fair Play case - it will be the independent commission who decide on any potential sanctions if the club were to be found guilty of any breaches of rules.

An article published by the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday claims “the Premier League has recommended the punishment to be extremely severe, and up to a maximum of 12 points,” adding that: “Everton’s case is currently being heard by an independent commission after they recorded financial losses of £371.8million over a three-year period, which is well over the permitted amount of £105million set out by the Premier League.”

If found guilty, the club are facing a number of potential other sanctions, including a fine and/or a potential transfer embargo but Everton have stressed they have complied with the rules and insist they will “robustly defend” their position, arguing that exemptions, including those related to the coronavirus crisis, will clear them of any wrongdoing.

The ECHO understands that the independent commission – not the Premier League – holds full sway when it comes to the final decision-making process.

In the event of a breach being found, the next step would be that the commission decide upon any sanctions and if any sanctions such as a points deduction were agreed upon then it would also be at the discretion of the commission to decide upon which season to impose them, whether that be current, retrospectively (the charge relates to the 2021/22 season) or in a future campaign.

Given that Norwich City, Watford and Burnley were relegated that season and the latter have subsequently been promoted again that potentially brings extra complications although the gap between Everton and Norwich City was 17 points and the Blues finished 15 points above Watford.

Portsmouth are the only Premier League club to have points taken off them for a financial matter having been deducted nine for entering administration in 2009/10, a season they would have finished bottom of the table regardless but the status of Everton’s case is unprecedented and there is no clear indication to the potential timeframe of the decision-making process which will also be up to the commission.

Although Everton face a single charge, Manchester City, Premier League champions for the past three seasons, have been charged with breaching 115 regulations over 14 seasons from 2009/10 to last season but no date has been fixed for them.

Everton, who have seven points from their first nine Premier League matches this season, are currently subject to a proposed takeover with majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri having struck a deal last month to sell his entire 94.1% stake to Miami-based private investment firm 777 Partners.

At the time, the club announced that the closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023 and remains subject to regulatory approval. But any potential sanctions from the panel could result in further delays, with Everton having the option to pursue the Premier League’s Rule W.62 for appeals which relates to challenging a decision taken by a commission.","Everton fans are encouraged to sign up for the EFC email bulletin to stay up to date on the latest news of the club as they face a potential Financial Fair Play charge, with any sanctions being decided by an independent commission."

A complaint from a conservative group against U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-St. Louis, was dismissed Wednesday by an oversight committee.

The Office of Congressional Ethics voted unanimously to dismiss the complaint filed March 3 by the Committee to Defeat the President, Bush’s campaign reported.

The complaint alleged that the Bush campaign’s employment of Cortney Merritts III violated federal election laws. Bush and Merritts married in February.

FEC rules do not contain a blanket prohibition on a candidate employing family members, provided they are being paid for “bona fide service” and paid “the fair market value.”

In a statement, Bush said the action by the ethics office was “welcome and long overdue.”

The committee that filed the complaint was formed in 2013 as the Stop Hillary PAC. Its web page states it is “committed to defeating the radical Left.”

Bush’s statement included a long criticism of the committee, saying in part: ""The political attacks on my campaign are a clear example of how right-wing extremist groups will stop at nothing to malign those of us unapologetically working in service of our communities,” Bush said.

A second, similar complaint against Bush’s campaign still is pending. It was filed by the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which bills itself as a nonpartisan watchdog group promoting “accountability, ethics and transparency.”","The Office of Congressional Ethics voted unanimously to dismiss a complaint against U.S. Rep.

The researchers investigated the performance of 182 firms that announced acquisitions of green entities. Wei and Pujari considered the stock price performances over a three-day window: the day before, the day of, and the day after an acquisition announcement. Based on this data, the researchers reported three principal findings.

First, shareholders generally welcomed news of green acquisitions. The initial outlay is usually substantial. However, by acquiring valuable resources, expertise, technologies and powerful brands, these companies will likely ensure long-term profitability.

Second, the news is especially welcomed if the buyer has highly developed marketing expertise and is not considered an industry innovator.

“This means buyers can effectively communicate their green efforts and have a great capability in being able to sense which trends will be perceived positively by the general public,” Wei explains.

“Investor and public reaction will be better for firms with lower innovation capabilities. It could be that shareholders might expect firms with higher innovation capability levels to be putting their innovation/research and development budgets and human capital into developing their own green products.”

The third finding applies to buyers with greater marketing expertise. The research showed that benefits will be buffered if the buyers belong to industries sensitive to environmental regulations, i.e., those companies operating in so-called “dirty” industries. Wei says she believes that this might be due in part to an increasing awareness of corporate greenwashing and the associated risk it entails.

“We sense a belief among shareholders: if firms from dirty industries genuinely want to improve people’s well-being and mitigate their negative effects on the environment, they may need to do something that is beyond buying green brands or technologies,” Wei notes.

“Investors are learning which firms are genuine in their commitments to a cleaner environment and whether their efforts are genuine or mere greenwashing. With these expectations in mind, they have different reactions to a firm’s green efforts. That will be played out in the stock market.”

“Companies should be more cautious if they think they can convince the public of their green credentials simply by buying these kinds of green firms.”

Read the cited paper: “Does buying green pay off? Stock market reactions to green acquisitions”","Researchers investigated the stock market reaction to acquisitions of green entities, finding that shareholders generally welcomed news of green acquisitions, but benefits were buffered for buyers from industries sensitive to environmental regulations. Companies were advised to be cautious in relying on green acquisitions to improve their public image."

Montreal recently launched its Réseau express métropolitain (REM), a light-rail rapid transit system linking the city’s southern suburbs to the downtown core. The project is the result of a partnership between an institutional investor (Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and the Quebec government, with a financial contribution from Hydro-Québec, a Crown corporation. This type of alliance has yet to prove its worth, but it shows that public transport projects can be designed differently.

A struggling industry

However, this launch comes at a difficult time for public transport. Since the pandemic, the number of urban public transit trips in Canada has fallen by 20 per cent, and even by 30 per cent per person if we factor in population growth. The result is a 13 per cent drop in revenues between June 2019 and June 2023, while expenses, due to inflation, have risen by 15 per cent over the same period.

With declining ridership, user contributions to transit budgets have also fallen, accounting for just over 25 per cent of revenues in Vancouver and Montreal. Only Toronto has managed to stabilize this contribution at 40 per cent, and then only by increasing fares at a rate of 35 per cent above inflation over 35 years.

These financial challenges have an impact on the sustainability of public transit systems. Indeed, when balancing the budget requires cutting expenses, it generally means reducing services. At the same time, users are very sensitive to service quality, and industry representatives are well aware of the risk of falling into a “death spiral.”

While some are looking forward to a return to normalcy, sadly, I do not share their hope. Hybrid and remote working is well established, and despite strong population growth in major cities, mainly due to immigration, we are not seeing a surge in the use of public transport. We have to get used to the new normal: it seems to be here to stay.

“With hybrid working and only a few days in the office, a monthly transit pass is often no longer necessary. In Montreal, it takes 26 trips to make it worthwhile. In Vancouver, it’s 33 trips, and in Toronto, it’s a whopping 47”

With hybrid working and only a few days in the office, a monthly transit pass is often no longer necessary. In Montreal, it takes 26 trips to make it worthwhile. In Vancouver, it’s 33 trips, and in Toronto, it’s a whopping 47. What’s more, without a monthly pass, many people further reduce their use of public transit for non-work trips.

Is fare-free public transit a viable solution?

Against this backdrop, the status quo when it comes to funding public transit is no longer tenable. We need to rethink our approach, and fare-free public transit, an idea that seemed far-fetched a few years ago, has been gaining ground since the pandemic. This past summer, Montreal made public transit fare-free for those over 65, and many U.S. cities, including Boston and New York, are beginning to do the same or test the idea. Meanwhile, free public transport is commonplace in many European centres. When it comes to weighing the pros and cons, how should we determine where we stand? Perhaps the additional costs of increased ridership would be offset by the efficiency gains of not charging fare at boarding (taking into account the lack of revenue, of course). It’s hard to say.

In any case, we can rethink the allocation of resources. Let’s imagine for a moment that the money spent on labour (inspectors, for example) and infrastructure (payment terminals, for example) to ensure that users pay their fare were instead used to address homelessness, addiction and mental health issues. In concrete terms, this would also mean that in Toronto, the 1,800 monthly interventions by fare inspectors would be replaced indefinitely by social interventions. These actions could have a significant impact on the attractiveness of public transit, which remains a barrier for some in 2023.

Moreover, fare-free public transit would significantly improve mobility for the greatest number of people, as currently certain segments of the population are over-represented in terms of ridership, such as racialized groups (3.7 times), immigrants (2.8 times more), young people (1.7 times), people with lower income (1.7 times) and women (1.6 times).

No one knows to what extent free public transit and more bike lanes would reduce traffic congestion, but I would choose the carrot over the stick, especially if we make it a project that we can all get behind.

Thanks for the figures



So if you think IPF is good value, what do you think of Vanquis?



It is about the same market cap as IPF now but it has twice the receivables at about £2 billion and it looks even better value than IPF



On Market Screener



The forecast PE for Vanquis is 2.5 in 2025 and 17% dividend

And forecast PE for IPF is 4 in 2025 and 10% dividend



Vanquis is mid cost credit and near prime now and so all the sub prime has gone and all the claims companies have gone



I think Vanquis and IPF are both good value, but I think Vanquis is better value at the present time



Have you looked at the figures for Vanquis?



Do you have your own estimates for Vanquis?

Straight forward. I've taken net shareholder's equity: currently £463m forecast to grow to £550m (my forecast) by the end of 2025. Reasonable given the 40%-45% dividend payout ratio.

And then applied 15% - 20% ROE. That gets you my EPS and Dividend numbers.



IPF currently has siginificantly more equity than it needs: Equity to receivables of c.50% (current) vs 40% (required). This leaves room for IPF to support receivables growth in Mexico and IPF Digital and in Poland (following transformation), which in turns delivers underlying revenue growth and generates scale to reduce the cost-income ratio to c.50%.



Two of the divisions (Mexico and European Credit) are already delivering c.20% RORE (ROE based on their ""Required"" equity). So, given the growth opportunities, I think achieving 20% ROE by 2025 is quite reasonable for the business as a whole.

Where are you getting your forecast figures from?



You said that this implies eps in 2025 of 36p-48p and dividend of 16p-22p and a dividend yield of between 13% and 18%



Have you just made the figures up?



These figures are completely out of line with the forecast figures for IPF on Market Screener



hxxps://www.marketsc reener.com/quote/sto ck/INTERNATIONAL-PER SONAL-FI-4007183/fin ances/



It shows forecast eps of 18p in 2023, 21p in 2024, 28p in 2025

And forecast dividend of 10p, 11p, and 12p in 2025



The forecast eps for Vanquis is 42p in 2025

And the forecast dividend for Vanquis is 18p in 2025



hxxps://www.marketsc reener.com/quote/sto ck/VANQUIS-BANKING-G ROUP-PLC-9590111/fin ances/



So with the Vanquis share price now lower than IPF, Vanquis seems to offer a far better investment with a forecast PE of 2.5 in 2025, and a forecast dividend of nearly 17% in 2025



The forecast PE for IPF is over 4 in 2025, and a forecast dividend of 10% in 2025



So they both look like that they may be good investments, but Vanquis looks much better value than IPF now

15:30 @badtime - the Fitch rating for the bonds is BB- which puts them in junk territory. This is down to the risks of sub-prime credit associated with actual / possible recession and the legislative and ESG risks to the business model (that pretty much finished the UK business a few years ago, for example).

11:35 I am a fan of IPF stock. Here is why.

Management expects ROE to be 15%-20% by 2025 and dividend payout to be c. 45%.

This implies eps in 2025 of 36p-48p and dividend of 16p-22p: a dividend yield of between 13% and 18%.

With 45% dividend payout it leaves 55% of net income to support growth. At 20% ROE this implies EPS and dividend growth of >10%.

This increase in profit (and ROE) is supported by: strong growth potential in Mexico, Poland (post transformation with new credit card product) and IPF digital; and improvement in the cost income ratio to management forecast of c.50% from 57% today

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Meta's Q4 guidance erases earnings-beat gains - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-q4-guidance-erases-earnings-beat-gains-212533296.html,"Meta (META) reported its third quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating on the top and bottom lines. However, an initial wave of optimism was stymied after the company issued conservative Q4 guidance.

In the company's earnings call, Meta CFO Susan Li said that geopolitical unrest – both recently in the Middle East and more broadly – is leading to a ""softening"" ad market.

""It’s hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event,"" Li told analysts. ""Historically, we’ve seen broader demand softness follow other regional conflicts in the past, such as the Ukraine war. So, this is something we’re continuing to monitor. We’ve reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we’ve seen into our Q4 outlook, which again, I think reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility ahead.""

The company's shares initially rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading, but erased those gains in the aftermath of Meta's call and were over 3% lower in Thursday's pre-market.

Meta's been navigating rough waters, steadying itself as an AI-powered advertising giant and working through its capital-intensive expansion into VR and AR. The Facebook and Instagram parent has been in the process of shoring up two key areas of interest for investors — its AI efforts and its position in the digital advertising market, which has been in a prolonged slump and is just showing signs of a rebound.

Meta's Q3 advertising revenue came in at $33.64 billion, compared to the expected $32.94 billion. The company beat on ad impressions estimates, clocking an increase of 31% year over year, versus the expected 29.6%.

Meta shares have risen more than 130% year to date, massively outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Internet Index, which are up around 9% and 34% this year, respectively.

""The stock has done well this year,"" Neuberger Bergman analyst Daniel Flax told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. ""[If they can] drive durable growth and translate that into earnings per share and free cash flow generation, I think the stock can continue to work its way higher.""

Story continues

Meta's near future could be mired in legal risks, as the company is staring down federal and state lawsuits from 42 attorneys general, who are alleging that Facebook and Instagram's features geared toward children are addictive.

""We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

Currently, Wall Street analysts' recommendations for Meta break down to 60 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sells.

The earnings rundown

Here are the key numbers that Meta reported, as compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Revenue: $34.15 billion actual, up 23% year-over-year, versus $33.52 billion expected

Earnings per share: $4.39 actual, up 168% year-over-year, versus $3.60 expected

Facebook daily active users: 2.09 billion actual, versus 2.07 billion expected

Reality Labs operating loss: $3.74 billion actual, versus $3.94 billion expected

Q4 revenue outlook: $36.5 billion-$40 billion actual, versus $38.76 billion expected

Zuckerberg's ""Year of Efficiency"" initiatives seem to be paying off, as the company is decreasing its 2023 capital expenditures outlook. It's revising the range to be between $27 billion and $29 billion, a decline from the previously announced $27 billion to $30 billion.

Meta's Family of Apps business, which also includes WhatsApp, raked in over $33 billion in revenue. The division's operating income was $17.49 billion for the quarter, handily beating analysts' expectation of $15.23 billion.

But Reality Labs, the company's mixed reality business, has been a subject of controversy. Since 2022, Meta has lost more than $20 billion running Reality Labs; $13.7 billion of that came from last year.

The company said it expects these losses to continue, and will increase notably year over year in 2023. Meta recently launched its Quest 3 headset, priced at $499.99.

""We had a good quarter for our community and business,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. ""I'm proud of the work our teams have done to advance AI and mixed reality with the launch of Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and our AI studio.""

Narrows 2023 operating guidance around midpoint and provides outlook for the fourth quarter

Affirms targeted 6-8% long-term annual operating earnings per share growth rate

AKRON, Ohio, Oct. 26, 2023 -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported third quarter 2023 GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $421 million, or $0.74 per basic share ($0.73 diluted), on revenue of $3.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2022, the company reported GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $334 million, or $0.58 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.5 billion. Results for both periods include the special items listed below.

Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* were $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2023, in the upper end of the company's guidance range. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings in the third quarter of 2022 were $0.79 per share.

Lower operating expenses, continued growth from regulated investments, stronger weather-adjusted sales and tax benefits from the expected use of state net operating loss carryforwards were positive earnings drivers in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. Together, they offset the impact of mild temperatures on Regulated Distribution sales, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022, as well as lower pension credits and higher financing costs, which were associated with higher debt issuances to support the company's capital program.

""FirstEnergy is focused on investing in our regulated businesses, our employees and our systems to enhance the customer experience, support our communities and create new opportunities from the energy transition,"" said Brian X. Tierney, president and chief executive officer. ""We are executing on this strategy, delivering strong operational and financial performance, and building our momentum for the future.""

FirstEnergy narrowed its full-year 2023 operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range to $2.49 to $2.59 per share based on 573 million shares outstanding, from its original range of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. In addition, the company is providing a guidance range of $315 million to $375 million, or $0.55 to $0.65 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, based on 574 million shares outstanding.

The company also affirmed its long-term, 6% to 8% targeted annual operating earnings per share growth rate, which is based off the previous year's operating earnings guidance midpoint.

Third Quarter Segment Results

In the Regulated Distribution business, lower operating expenses, higher revenues related to utility investment programs and higher weather-adjusted load compared to the third quarter of 2022 were offset by lower weather-related demand resulting from mild summer temperatures across the company's service footprint, as well as lower pension credits and higher interest expense from higher debt balances to fund the company's capital programs.

Total weather-adjusted distribution deliveries increased 1.2% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Weather-adjusted sales to residential and commercial customers increased 2.3% and 1.2%, respectively, while industrial sales were unchanged.

Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to cooling degree days that were 6% below normal and 17% below last year. Usage decreased 3.5% among residential customers and 1.2% in the commercial sector, while industrial sales were flat.

In the Regulated Transmission business, third quarter 2023 operating results benefited from the company's ongoing Energizing the Future investment program. Rate base increased by more than 8% from the third quarter of 2022.

In Corporate/Other, third quarter 2023 operating results improved compared to the third quarter of 2022 as a result of income tax benefits and lower operating expenses.

Year-to-Date Results

For the first nine months of 2023, FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $948 million, or $1.66 per basic share ($1.65 diluted), on revenue of $9.7 billion. This compares to GAAP earnings of $809 million, or $1.42 per basic share ($1.41 diluted), on revenue from continuing operations of $9.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Results for both periods reflect the impact of special items listed below.

Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* for the first nine months of 2023 were $1.94 per share, compared to $1.91 per share in the first nine months of 2022.

Year-to-date results for 2023 reflect lower operating expenses, continued growth from the company's regulated investment strategy, stronger weather-adjusted load and tax benefits. These offset the impact of lower weather-related demand, which reduced earnings by $0.24 per share compared to the first nine months of 2022, and lower pension credits.

Through the first nine months, heating degree days were 17% below normal and 16% below last year, while cooling degree days were 16% and 25% below normal and last year, respectively.

The current and deferred income tax effect was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pre-tax amount if deductible/taxable. The income tax rate ranges from 21% to 29%. Basic continuing operations EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) is based on 571 million shares for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months 2022 and 573 million shares for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months 2023.

Non-GAAP financial measures

* Certain financial measures, including Operating earnings (loss), Operating earnings (loss) per share (""EPS""), including by segment, are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to the extent they exclude the impact of ""special items.""

Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Operating earnings (loss), Operating EPS, including by segment, also exclude the impact of Discontinued Operations. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items in the context of long-term annual operating EPS growth rate projections because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. Consequently, the Company is unable to reconcile operating earnings guidance and long-term annual operating EPS growth projections to a GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. Operating EPS is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes special items as discussed above, for the periods presented by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, which is 571 million shares for the third quarter, first nine months, and full year 2022, 573 million shares for the third quarter, first nine months of 2023, and full year 2023, and 574 million shares for the fourth quarter of 2023. Intercompany money pool interest expense/income between Regulated Transmission and Corporate/Other associated with the proceeds from the FET 19.9% minority interest transaction received on May 31, 2022, has been eliminated for segment reporting purposes which is consistent with the methodology used in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 reporting. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Operating earnings (loss) and Operating EPS, including by segment, to evaluate the Company's and its segments' performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss) and Operating EPS, including by segment, provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company's peer group. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FE has provided, where possible without unreasonable effort, quantitative reconciliations within this presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,"7 ""Best"" Financial Magazines (October 2023) - Securities.io",https://www.securities.io/best-financial-magazines/,"Information is probably the most valuable asset of an investor, as markets are ultimately driven by fundamental factors.

Both institutional and retail investors would like to be the first to access meaningful insights that could provide relevant arguments for making quality decisions.

In this article, we present seven financial magazines that every savvy investor should know about. Most of them have built a global network of quality sources consisting of experienced journalists, business executives, government representatives, and expert analysts that have first-hand knowledge of current affairs.

According to The Economist, which we’re about to review below, “the world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data.”

Here are our picks for the best financial magazines:

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) provides some of the most solid insights into financial and economic topics, mostly focused on the US markets. The New York-based newspaper has been around for over 130 years. While the WSJ is thought to embrace the moderate right bias, the journal provides a variety of opinions, but most importantly, it publishes regular analysis of financial markets, covering stocks, bonds, foreign exchange pairs, real estate, funds, and digital assets, among others.

The WSJ is part of Dow Jones & Company, Inc, which is a subsidiary of News Corp. Dow Jones is behind several other reputable financial media businesses, including Barron’s and MarketWatch.

While readers can go through a few articles for free, the online version of the newspaper is available to subscribers only. At the time of writing, the basic digital option costs about $10 per month, but the paper markets a limited offer of $2 per month for the first year.

Bloomberg is an independent media business founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, businessman and former mayor of New York.

Besides the news site and the weekly BusinessWeek magazine, the company offers its Bloomberg Terminal service, which comprises advanced analytical software tools that help investors monitor financial markets.

Bloomberg offers factual daily analysis of all markets, and it can also share its take on various topics. Bloomberg has a crypto section that consists of regular updates on digital assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain.

Last month, Bloomberg a BusinessWeek issue covered a single story titled “the Crypto Story,” which was written by columnist Matt Levine.

One can access only a few stories for free. Bloomberg’s standard subscription option, Digital Access, is available for about $200 per year. There is also a Student Subscription option available for $10 per month. The Terminal service is aimed at professionals and costs about $20,000 per year.

The Financial Times (FT) can be regarded as the London version of the WSJ in some way, as the two offer regular business and financial analysis and stories that use the most credible sources. Like the WSJ, the FT has been around for over 130 years. The paper is now run by Japanese media giant Nikkei, which purchased it in 2015 for over $1.3 billion.

As of 2020, the FT had over 26 million readers worldwide, a third of which operated in the financial sector.

The digital version of the paper is one of the most reliable business intelligence resources on the web. FT publishes news and analysis on multiple markets and assets. It also provides data and tools to monitor financial markets in real-time.

FT’s standard digital subscription option is available for about $40 per month.

Another major economic newspaper based in London is The Economist. Founded in 1843, the news and analysis resource is more focused on business, economics, and politics, with a strong emphasis on expert opinion and data journalism.

The company behind the paper is owned by a group of shareholders that include the powerful Italian family Agnelli, as well as Rothschild and Cadbury.

Readers of the Economist are usually familiar with the fundamental concepts of economics and already understand terms like macroeconomics or the invisible hand. The writing style may include a lot of metaphors and allusions, and most articles usually don’t display the author or the editor.

The paper is also well-known for creating special edition covers each year that try to predict major events for the following year.

One can read several articles for free on the Economist page. For more articles, the paper offers a standard subscription that costs about $160 in the first year.

The MIT Sloan Management Review presents itself as a research-based magazine aimed at business executives. It is published at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by the university’s business school, known as the MIT Sloan School of Management.

The digital version is updated on a daily basis and focuses on long-form thought leadership and opinion articles discussing a wide range of topics, including economics, technology, and business.

Readers can either buy articles separately in PDF format or subscribe for a discount price of $45 per year.

MorningStar is a Chicago-based research and analysis platform that provides regular news as well as analysis tools and ratings to help investors make informed decisions. The platform focuses on stocks, funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and bonds, among others.

Investors can select from a wide range of tools to analyze the best and worst-performing assets, create a portfolio, monitor prices, and conduct in-depth analysis. Some of the professional tools include Morningstar Direct, ESG Investing Solutions, Morningstar Reporting Solutions, Morningstar Research, Pitchbook, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar indexes, among others.

MorningStar also provides personal finance resources to help investors become financially independent.

The service is aimed at both institutional and retail traders across the US and globally.

Access to MorningStar news and tools costs about $250 per year, with a seven-day free trial available to newcomers.

MoneyWeek is a London-based weekly online magazine established in 2000.

The magazine publishes news pieces and thought leadership articles covering UK and global markets as well as personal finance topics.

“MoneyWeek’s mission is to bring you news, analysis and information to help you make informed investment decisions as well as bring you the news that matters to your personal finances,” the site reads.

The magazine’s first six issues are available for free, with the next 13 ones being offered for a total of over $40."," as the Rothschilds.The Economist’s digital version is available to subscribers only. The paper offers an annual subscription plan for $190 per year.This article reviews seven financial magazines that every investor should know about.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Senate Finance Committee probe into Clarence Thomas finds that ... - Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-finance-committee-probe-clarence-231312783.html,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to repay a “significant” portion of a $267,230 loan from a friend that allowed him to buy a luxury motorcoach in 1999, according to a memo issued Wednesday by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee.

But hours after the report appeared on the committee’s website, a lawyer for Thomas disputed its findings in a rare statement.

“The loan was never forgiven,” Elliot S. Berke, a lawyer for Thomas, said in a statement, adding that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Berke’s statement appeared at odds with the committee’s findings.

The committee said in the memo that documents it reviewed showed Thomas only paid some interest on the loan. The committee also said the omission from the justice’s financial disclosure forms raises fresh questions about whether he “properly reported the associated income on his tax returns.”

But Berke said that Thomas and his wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, made the necessary payments.

“The Thomases made all payments to Mr. Welters on a regular basis until the terms of the agreement were satisfied in full,” he said. Berke declined to provide additional information.

The New York Times first reported the congressional memorandum Wednesday and in August, on the financial arrangement between Thomas and his friend Anthony Welters, which triggered Democrats on the Senate committee to launch their investigation.

The committee’s revelations are the latest to dog Thomas. The justice has come under fire in recent months from critics who charge him with skirting ethics rules by accepting lavish trips and rides on private jets without always disclosing them on his annual financial disclosures he’s required to submit.

The committee qualifies its new report by noting that “additional documents pertaining to the loan agreement may exist” but that so far “none of the documents reviewed by Committee staff indicated that Thomas ever made payments” to his friend in “excess of the annual interest on the loan.”

“Now we know that Justice Thomas had up to $267,230 in debt forgiven and never reported it on his ethics forms,” Chairman Ron Wyden said in a Wednesday statement, before Berke issued his statement.

“Regular Americans don’t get wealthy friends to forgive huge amounts of debt so they can buy a second home. Justice Thomas should inform the committee exactly how much debt was forgiven and whether he properly reported the loan forgiveness on his tax returns and paid all taxes owed,” the Oregon Democrat said.

A Supreme Court press officer said she had no comment on the report and CNN’s calls to Welters went unreturned.

According to the new report, back in 1999, Thomas entered into an agreement with Welters, who personally loaned him money to help finance the purchase of the RV: a Prevost Marathon motorcoach.

Welters told the Times this summer that the loan was ultimately “satisfied” in 2008, but the new report offers more details about the transactions.

In the report summary released by the committee, its staff said they received more information about the loan, including a handwritten note from Thomas on Supreme Court stationery dated December 6, 1999. The documents included a promissory note detailing that the principal balance of the note had an interest rate of 7.5% per year.

In 2004, the loan was extended for 10 years. According to the summary, committee staff reviewed a note from Welters in 2008 that stated that Thomas had been paying him interest only on the vehicle for “many years” and that Welters would no longer seek payment because he believed that Thomas had paid interest greater than the purchase price of the bus.

According to the report, “Welters did not feel it was appropriate to continue to accept payments even though he had the right to them.”

But the committee staff said that “none of the documents” reviewed by staff “indicated that Thomas ever made payments to Welters in excess of the annual interest on the loan.”

“Based on the documents reviewed by Committee staff, Anthony Welters forgave a substantial amount, or even all of the principal balance of his loan to Clarence Thomas, constituting of the forgiveness of approximately $267, 230 of debt owed by Justice Thomas,” the report concludes.

The summary says the new revelations raise “a number of potentially serious tax questions” for Thomas because the failure to repay the entire principal of the loan “would have generated a significant amount of taxable income for Justice Thomas.”

The report also says that Thomas failed to report the forgiven debt on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report.

“Since the loan agreement with Welters was first reported in August 2023, Justice Thomas has not provided any information on loan payments made to Welters, or stated whether he properly reported the income from the forgiven debt on his tax returns,” the report concludes.

and our new product portfolio, partially offset by lower average net selling prices. On a GAAP basis, gross margin decreased from 79.0% to 77.1% and on a Non-GAAP basis, decreased from 79.8% to 77.3% primarily due to product mix and lower hedge settlement gains.

On a GAAP basis, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% to $2.0 billion in the quarter primarily due to higher advertising and promotion costs to support new product launches, partially offset by the cash settlement of Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (""Turning Point"") unvested stock awards in 2022. On a Non-GAAP basis, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% to $1.9 billion in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising and promotion costs to support new product launches.

On a GAAP basis, research and development expenses decreased 7% to $2.2 billion in the quarter due to lower clinical grants and supplies and cash settlement of Turning Point unvested stock awards in 2022. On a Non-GAAP basis, research and development expenses decreased 4% to $2.2 billion in the quarter primarily due to lower clinical grants and supplies.

On a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis, Acquired IPRD increased to $80 million in the quarter from $30 million in the same period a year ago. On a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis, licensing income was $12 million in the quarter compared to $73 million in the same period a year ago.

On a GAAP basis, amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased 7% to $2.3 billion in the quarter, primarily due to the Abraxane marketed product right being fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2022.

marketed product right being fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2022. On a GAAP basis, effective tax rate changed from 27.2% to 9.5% in the quarter and on a Non-GAAP basis the effective tax rate changed from 16.9% to 11.6%, primarily due to changes in the IRS income tax guidance regarding deductibility of certain non-U.S. research and development expenses.

The company reported on a GAAP basis net earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $1.9 billion, or $0.93 per share, in the third quarter compared to $1.6 billion, or $0.75 per share, for the same period a year ago.

THIRD QUARTER PRODUCT REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS

In-Line Products

Revenues for in-line products in the third quarter were $8.3 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year period. In-line products revenue was largely driven by:

Opdivo worldwide revenues increased 11% reported and when adjusted for foreign exchange. U.S. revenues increased 9% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher demand. International revenues were $923 million compared to $804 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of 15% reported and when adjusted for foreign exchange, primarily due to higher demand as a result of launches for additional indications and core indications.

worldwide revenues increased 11% reported and when adjusted for foreign exchange. U.S. revenues increased 9% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher demand. International revenues were $923 million compared to $804 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of 15% reported and when adjusted for foreign exchange, primarily due to higher demand as a result of launches for additional indications and core indications. Eliquis worldwide revenues increased 2% compared to the prior year period. U.S. revenues were $1.8 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year period, representing an increase of 4% primarily due to higher demand, partially offset by GTN adjustments in 2023. International revenues were $906 million compared to $926 million in the prior year period, representing a decrease of 2%, primarily driven by lower average net selling prices and generic erosion in Canada and the U.K.

New Product Portfolio

New product portfolio worldwide revenues increased to $928 million compared to $553 million in the prior year period, representing a growth of 68%, primarily driven by higher demand across the portfolio, including for Opdualag, Sotyktu, Camzyos, Reblozyl, Zeposia and Breyanzi.

Recent LOE Products

Revlimid worldwide revenues declined by 41% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to generic erosion and, as previously disclosed, an increase in the number of patients receiving free drug product from the Bristol Myers Squibb Patient Assistance Foundation, a separate and independent 501(c)(3) entity to which the company donates products.

PRODUCT AND PIPELINE UPDATE

Bristol Myers Squibb recently achieved significant regulatory and clinical milestones, including an important U.S. regulatory approval for Reblozyl in first-line, MDS-associated anemia. In addition, the company achieved strong results from a Phase 3 study evaluating subcutaneous nivolumab and received two key approvals—from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission for Opdivo in stage IIB or IIC melanoma. The company also announced initial data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating a perioperative regimen including Opdivo in non-small cell lung cancer, as well as positive Phase 2 results evaluating its potential first-in-class LPA 1 antagonist in progressive pulmonary fibrosis.

Cardiovascular

Category Asset Milestone Clinical & Research Camzyos® (mavacamten) Data from the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of the MAVA-LTE study showed sustained improvements in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, symptoms and NT-proBNP levels in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) based on a cumulative 120-week analysis. In addition, long-term follow-up results from the Phase 3 VALOR-HCM LTE trial demonstrated the consistent impact of oral treatment for severely symptomatic obstructive HCM patients by showing that nearly nine out of 10 patients treated with Camzyos have continued in the trial without septal reduction therapy at either 40 or 56 weeks of treatment. Eliquis® (apixaban) Results presented by the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance from ATHENS, a retrospective real-world data study, demonstrated that switching from Eliquis to rivaroxaban in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients was associated with a higher risk of stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding than those who continued Eliquis.

Oncology

Category Asset Milestone Regulatory Opdivo® (nivolumab) The FDA approved the supplemental Biologics License Application for Opdivo as a monotherapy in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of eligible patients with completely resected stage IIB or IIC melanoma. The approval is based on results from the CheckMate -76K trial. The European Commission approved Opdivo as a monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with stage IIB or IIC melanoma who have undergone complete resection. The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -76K trial. Clinical & Research Opdivo First results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -901 trial demonstrated that Opdivo in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by Opdivo monotherapy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the primary efficacy endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival compared to standard-of-care cisplatin-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. First data disclosure from the Phase 3 CheckMate -77T trial evaluating the perioperative regimen of neoadjuvant Opdivo with chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant Opdivo in patients with resectable stage IIA to IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint of event-free survival compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and placebo followed by surgery and adjuvant placebo. Three-year follow-up results from exploratory analyses of the Phase 3 CheckMate -816 trial demonstrated sustained event-free survival (EFS) and promising overall survival trends with three cycles of Opdivo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with resectable NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. Neoadjuvant Opdivo with chemotherapy also showed improvements in pathologic complete response (pCR) and major pathologic response (MPR) over chemotherapy alone in PD-L1 ≥1% and <1% patient populations. Part B of the Phase 3 CheckMate -914 trial, evaluating Opdivo as an adjuvant treatment for patients with localized renal cell carcinoma who have undergone full or partial removal of the kidney and who are at a moderate or high risk of relapse, did not meet the primary endpoint of disease-free survival as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review. The safety profile was consistent with previously reported studies of other Opdivo and Opdivo-based combinations in solid tumors. Subcutaneous nivolumab Results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -67T trial evaluating subcutaneous nivolumab in advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma demonstrated noninferior pharmacokinetics and overall response rate (co-primary endpoints) and objective response rate (key secondary endpoint) when compared to intravenous Opdivo. The company looks forward to discussing next steps for subcutaneous nivolumab with health authorities across multiple indications. Opdivo+Yervoy Six-year follow-up results from Part 1 of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial demonstrated long-term, durable survival benefits of Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. repotrectinib Updated results from the registrational Phase 1/2 TRIDENT-1 study demonstrated that repotrectinib, a next-generation ROS1/TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, continued to show high response rates and durable responses in patients with ROS1-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The FDA granted Priority Review of the New Drug Application for repotrectinib and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of November 27, 2023.

Hematology

Category Asset Milestone Regulatory Reblozyl® (luspatercept-aamt) The FDA approved Reblozyl for the treatment of anemia without previous erythropoiesis stimulating agent use (ESA-naïve) in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who may require regular red blood cell transfusions. The approval is based on interim results from the pivotal Phase 3 COMMANDS trial, expanding Reblozyl indication to the first-line setting regardless of ring sideroblast status and enabling treatment across a broader array of patients.

Immunology

Category Asset Milestone Regulatory LPA 1 antagonist BMS-986278 The FDA granted BMS-986278, a potential first-in-class oral, lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA 1 ) antagonist, Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF). Clinical & Research LPA 1 antagonist Results from the Phase 2 study evaluating BMS-986278 in patients with PPF demonstrated that twice-daily administration of 60mg of BMS-986278 over 26 weeks reduced the rate of decline in percent predicted forced vital capacity by 69% compared to placebo. Sotyktu™ (deucravacitinib) Results from the POETYK-PSO long-term extension trial of Sotyktu treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis demonstrated that clinical response was maintained at 73.2% for Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 with 3 years of continuous Sotyktu treatment. Sotyktu demonstrated a consistent safety profile with no increases in adverse or serious adverse events and no new safety signals. Zeposia® (ozanimod) First interim readout from the Phase 3b ENLIGHTEN trial demonstrated that almost half of patients with early relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) have clinically meaningful improvement in cognitive functioning compared to baseline after one year of Zeposia treatment. In addition, late-breaking data from the DAYBREAK and RADIANCE trials demonstrated that, after eight years of follow-up, 76% of patients treated with Zeposia for RMS were free of six-month confirmed disability progression. Findings also demonstrated treatment with Zeposia resulted in low rates of progression-independent relapse activity and relapse-associated worsening, key drivers of disease progression and permanent disability in multiple sclerosis.

Research and Development (R&D) Update

In September, Bristol Myers Squibb hosted an R&D Day highlighting its advancing pipeline and differentiated research platforms to support long-term sustainable growth. During the presentation, members of the company's leadership team discussed:

The strengthening of Bristol Myers Squibb's scientific leadership and the advancement of a promising pipeline;

An expectation of doubling registrational assets from six to 12 over the next 18 months;

More than 25 indication expansion opportunities on the horizon and nine high-potential early assets that are expected to advance in the company’s pipeline;

Differentiated research platforms that support long-term growth, including Cell Therapy and Targeted Protein Degradation;

Increased depth across the company’s oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular therapeutic areas and a growing presence in neuroscience; and

Efforts to further increase and sustain the productivity of its R&D engine and bring treatments to patients faster.

Business Development

In October 2023, the company announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (""Mirati""), a commercial-stage targeted oncology company. The pending acquisition, when complete, is expected to strengthen and diversify Bristol Myers Squibb's oncology franchise, add KRAZATI (adagrasib), a best-in-class KRASG12C inhibitor currently approved in lung cancer, to its commercial oncology portfolio, and add MRTX1719, a potential first-in-class MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor in Phase 1 development. Bristol Myers Squibb also gains access to several promising clinical and pre-clinical stage assets, including additional KRAS inhibitors and enabling programs.

Capital Allocation

The company maintains a balanced approach to capital allocation focused on prioritizing investment for growth through business development, maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing the dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Dividend decisions are subject to approval by the Board of Directors.

In August, the company announced that it had entered into accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements to repurchase, in aggregate, $4 billion of Bristol Myers Squibb common stock. The company anticipates that final settlement of these transactions will occur during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG)

As a leading biopharmaceutical company, we understand our responsibility extends well beyond the discovery, development and delivery of innovative medicines. Our evolving ESG strategy builds on a legacy of comprehensive and global sustainability efforts that seek to drive business value and positively impact patients, employees, communities and the planet.

In August 2023, the company published its latest ESG report, which details the company's goals, strategies and performance across four ESG focus areas: ethics, integrity and quality; health equity and healthcare access; global inclusion and diversity; and environmental sustainability. Highlights include: Increased access for underserved communities. Progress toward global inclusion and diversity and health equity aspirational goals. Expanded clinical trial diversity and advanced supplier diversity. A reduced environmental footprint. Strengthened ESG oversight and accountability.

Bristol Myers Squibb was inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable, joining other Fortune 100 companies that have invested $1 billion with diverse-owned suppliers.

Financial Guidance

Bristol Myers Squibb is revising its 2023 GAAP and Non-GAAP line item guidance as follows:

Adjusting total revenues for Revlimid to be approximately $6.0 billion.

to be approximately $6.0 billion. Adjusting GAAP diluted EPS range to $3.68-$3.83 and raising midpoint of Non-GAAP diluted EPS range, with the new range being $7.50-$7.65.

Adjusting GAAP tax rate to approximately 11% and adjusting Non-GAAP tax rate to approximately 15.5%, primarily due to a reduction in previously estimated taxes resulting from changes in the income tax guidance regarding deductibility of certain non-U.S. research and development expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management has evaluated the company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures presented portray the results of the company's baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of the company’s underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. In addition, Non-GAAP gross margin, which is gross profit excluding certain specified items, as a percentage of revenues, Non-GAAP operating margin, which is gross profit less marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expense excluding certain specified items as a percentage of revenues, Non-GAAP operating expenses, which is marketing, selling and administrative and research and development expenses excluding certain specified items, Non-GAAP marketing, selling and administrative expense, which is marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding certain specified items, and Non-GAAP research and development expenses, which is research and development expenses excluding certain specified items, are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.

This earnings release and the accompanying tables also provide certain revenues and expenses as well as Non-GAAP measures excluding the impact of foreign exchange (""Ex-Fx""). We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Ex-Fx financial measures are not accounted for according to GAAP because they remove the effects of currency movements from GAAP results.

Non-GAAP financial measures such as Non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from Non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company’s business nor reflect the company’s underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, divestiture gains or losses, stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments), income resulting from the change in control of the Nimbus Therapeutics TYK2 Program and amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from a Non-U.S. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments.

Because the Non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures presented in the press release that are prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying financial tables and will also be available on the company’s website at www.bms.com. Within the accompanying financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.

Also note that a reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses and Non-GAAP effective tax rate is not provided because comparable GAAP measures for such measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably predict the impact of the unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, or currency exchange rates beyond the next twelve months. In addition, the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. The variability of the specified items may have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future GAAP results.

Central bank's carbon cut tool will spur big lenders to back 2,817 companies as more than $13 billion comes into play

China has seen booming growth of green finance, backed by policies and regulations, as the country accelerates its green transition and economic restructuring to achieve high-quality and sustainable development.

The People's Bank of China launched a carbon emissions reduction facility in November to offer low-interest loans to financial institutions that help firms cut emissions. Using the new monetary policy instrument, the central bank will provide 60 percent of loan principal made by financial institutions for carbon emissions reductions at a one-year lending rate of 1.75 percent.

The PBOC has issued the first batch of funds worth 85.5 billion yuan ($13.42 billion) via the facility in support of financial institutions' issuances of carbon emissions reduction loans totaling 142.5 billion yuan. It is estimated that the loans will help 2,817 companies cut carbon emissions by about 28.76 million metric tons, said Sun Guofeng, head of the monetary policy department at the PBOC, at a news conference on Dec 30.

The central bank released a new set of assessment measures last year for financial institutions' performance in developing and promoting green finance. It will further improve the practice of assessing financial institutions' green finance performance through substantial efforts, such as exploring the establishment of open, transparent, authoritative and unified institutions for green finance data statistics, enlarging the scope of green financial products included in the evaluation system and enriching usage scenarios for such products, said Wang Xin, director-general of the research bureau of the PBOC.

As China's financial system relies mainly on indirect finance, green loans－the most important green finance instrument－still account for 90 percent of green financial products in total. By the end of the third quarter, the outstanding balance of China's green loans reached nearly 15 trillion yuan, Wang said.

Last year, the central bank established clearer standards for green finance, offered more comprehensive incentives and launched more monetary policy instruments, he added.

The PBOC released the Green Bond Endorsed Projects Catalogue (2021 Edition) in April, together with the National Development and Reform Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, signifying the unification of domestic standards for green bonds.

Updating previous guidelines, the new document adopts more scientific and precise definitions on green projects. Carbon-intensive projects such as cleaner use of coal and other fossil fuels are no longer supported, said Moody's Analytics, a provider of financial intelligence and analytical tools.

By aligning with international standards, the catalogue will boost the confidence of international investors in Chinese green bonds and increase their willingness to buy such bonds, said SynTao Green Finance, a consultancy providing services in green finance and responsible investment in China.

The new guidelines encourage green bond issuances in the country. As of the end of the third quarter, the outstanding balance of domestic green bonds was 1.02 trillion yuan, up 24.7 percent year-on-year. The growth rate was 5.8 percentage points higher than that by the end of the previous quarter, said Wang with the PBOC.

Building a system of green finance standards is a crucial link in a top-level design for green finance and an important foundation to achieve leapfrog development in this area, said Liu Jin, president of Bank of China Ltd.

""With continuous expansion of green finance globally, the unification of standards for green loans and green bonds is imminent. My suggestion is that China should create domestically unified standards for green loans and green bonds that are geared to international standards, clear and executable. Based on the above situation, China should further establish standards for other green financial instruments to guide green finance heading in the right direction and to help increase regulatory efficiency of all countries,"" Liu said.

The ongoing global green transition requires huge funding. Therefore, financial institutions must set a more progressive target for green lending to provide strong support to the industries focusing on energy conservation and environmental protection, clean energy, cleaner production and green upgrading of infrastructure, he said.

In the meantime, financial institutions should also provide diversified financing channels and adopt a full life cycle service model for green industries according to their growth potential and risk probability, accelerate the development of financial products such as green bonds, funds, insurance and equity investments, and deepen innovation of financial products associated with carbon trading, he added.

Lyu Jiajin, chairman of Industrial Bank Co Ltd, a national joint-stock commercial bank based in Fuzhou, Fujian province, also encouraged financial institutions to fully utilize indirect and direct financing instruments to boost business expansion, promote structural optimization and create their own green asset-balance sheets.

""Financial institutions must clearly identify the general trends of our nation and actively shoulder the responsibility of a low-carbon transition of the Chinese economy by giving full play to their unique functions of financing, price discovery and risk management,"" Lyu said.

""They should ramp up efforts to push for a green transformation of traditional industries and the development of clean energy, green construction and green transportation, strongly support industrialization of digital technologies and digitalization of various industries, and promote all activities which will help improve operational efficiency of society and reduce carbon emissions.""

Lyu urged financial institutions to make full use of their advantages in account management, payments and settlements, investment transactions and information technologies to help all kinds of market entities manage carbon assets, activate carbon pricing and help create a larger carbon trading market.

Industrial Bank aims to double its outstanding green financing balance during China's 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25). As of the end of September, the balance was 1.31 trillion yuan, up about 13 percent from the beginning of last year, covering 33,000 corporate clients.

While China is striving to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, tremendous investment and financing demand associated with green manufacturing and green consumption will create huge growth opportunities for China's banking and insurance sectors, said Zhou Liang, vice-chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

""During the process of green and low-carbon development, China's financial sector will keep improving its environmental and climate-related risk management capability. As a result, the overall financial system will become more resilient, safer and more sustainable,"" Zhou said.

China will gradually improve the institutional framework for low-carbon development and green finance, establish a green finance statistical monitoring and evaluation system, and set standards for green finance information disclosure, he said.

Financial services professionals suggest the government accelerate efforts to promote the corporate disclosure of environmental information.

The work of promoting forced disclosure of environmental information could be first conducted by listed companies or in the country's green finance pilot zones, so that financial institutions will be provided with necessary information to realize green financial product innovation and to identify climate-related risks, said Zhang Weiwu, senior executive vice-president of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd."," bonds has become an important force in encouraging the green transition of the economy,"" he said.The PBOC has provided low-interest loans to financial institutions to support companies in reducing carbon emissions, which is estimated to help 2,817 companies cut 28.76 million metric tons of emissions. The central bank has also released updated guidelines for green finance and green bonds, which have been adopted by international investors, increasing the willingness to buy Chinese green bonds. This will help China achieve its goal of a green economy and economic restructuring."
2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Falana to Finance Minister: Direct NNPC to remit $34.2 billion ...,https://nairametrics.com/2023/10/26/falana-tells-finance-minister-to-direct-nnpc-to-remit-34-2-billion-illegally-diverted-funds/,"Human Rights Activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, has asked the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Olawale Edun, to direct the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited (NNPCL) to remit the sum of $34.2 billion to the Federation account.

Falana said that the said amount was received on behalf of the Government of Nigeria from the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited from 2004 to 2021.

This was made known in a letter titled, ‘Request To Recover $34.2bn Being Dividend Collected By NNPCL On Behalf Of The Federation’, dated October 24 and written by Falana to the Minister.

Falana in the letter recalled instances where monies were said to have been remitted by the NLNG to the NNPCL.

The senior lawyer said that the sum totaling $34.2 billion was received on behalf of the Government of Nigeria from the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited from 2004 to 2021, noting that the decision of the NNPCL to divert the said sum of $34.2 billion from the Federation is not backed by any law.

Threatens legal action

The senior advocate said he would not hesitate to initiate legal proceedings at the Federal High Court for the immediate recovery of the said sum of $34.2 billion from the NNPCL if the finance minster fails to direct that the money be remitted to the Federation account.

Falana said, ‘’However, if you fail to accede to our humble request, we shall not hesitate to initiate legal proceedings at the Federal High Court for immediate recovery of the said sum of $34.2 billion from the NNPCL. We shall also pray the Court to direct the NLNG to remit dividends earned by Nigeria to the Federation Account forthwith.’’

What the letter is saying

The letter from Falana reads,

“On April 27, 2019, the Senate Committee on Public Accounts held a public hearing on revenue generation drive for the 2021-2023 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP).

“During the hearing, the NLNG General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Mrs. Eyono Fatai-Williams, disclosed that from 1999 to 2019 the company paid dividends of over $18 billion to Nigeria through the NNPCL from 2004 to 2020. She also revealed that the NLNG paid $9 billion tax to the federal government from 2011 to date while $15 billion had also been remitted for feed gas to the NNPC since the inception of the company.

“Based on the disclosure, the Senate Committee on Public Accounts asked the suspended Accountant-General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris who was in attendance, to confirm if the said sum of $33 billion was actually remitted to the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited that represents the interest of Nigeria in the NLNG.

“Mr. Idris said that the funds paid by the NLNG were not remitted to the Federation Account but warehoused by the NNPCL.

“Consequently, the Public Accounts Committee of the Senate directed the Accountant-General to determine how much was actually remitted to the Federation Account, and if there was any deduction by NNPC; how much was deducted and who authorized the deductions and the exchange rates applied for the amount that was remitted over the years under review.

‘’Further more on 29th March 2021, while speaking at the virtual Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS) 2021 Pre-Summit Conference and the official launch of the Decade of Gas in Abuja, former President Muhammadu Buhari disclosed that the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) had generated $114 Billion in revenues over the years with $9 Billion in taxes remitted to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).

“Apart from the tax remittance, the former President said that NLNG paid $18 Billion as dividends and $15 Billion in Feed Gas Purchases (FGP) to the Federal Government through the Nigerian National Petroleum Commission Limited (NNPC).

“It may interest you to note that in 2020 and 2021, the NNPCL equally received the sums of $545.13m and $722.44m respectively as dividends from the NLNG. The total sum for the two years is $1.267 billion.

“From the information at our disposal, the said sum of $1.267 billion was not remitted to the Federation Account by the NNPCL. Therefore, the NNPCL is withholding a total sum of $34.2 billion from the Federation Account.

“In the light of the foregoing, you will agree with us that the decision of the NNPCL to divert the said sum of $34.2 billion from the Federation is not backed by any law.

“We are compelled to request you to direct the NNPCL to remit the said sum of $34.2 billion to the Federation account as the said sum was received on behalf of the Government of Nigeria from the NLNG from 2004-2021.

‘’However, if you fail to accede to our humble request, we shall not hesitate to initiate legal proceedings at the Federal High Court for immediate recovery of the said sum of $34.2 billion from the NNPCL. We shall also pray the Court to direct the NLNG to remit dividends earned by Nigeria to the Federation Account forthwith.

‘’While hoping that you will accede to our request, please accept the assurances of our highest esteem.’’"," the NNPC has not remitted the sum of $34.2 billion being the total dividend received by it on behalf of the Federal Government from the NLNG from 2004 to 2021.’’Femi Falana, a human rights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), has asked the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy to direct the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited (NNPCL) to remit the sum of $34.2 billion to the Federation account, which was said to have been accumulated from the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited from 2004 to 2021. If the minister fails to accede, Falana has threatened to initiate legal proceedings for the immediate recovery of the said sum."
2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Chinese Government Puts a New Leash on its Financial Sector,https://www.thedailyupside.com/policy-power/regulation/chinese-government-puts-a-new-leash-on-its-financial-sector/,"“To get rich is glorious,” Deng Xiaoping proclaimed as China embarked on its path to hypercapitalism a generation ago. Under President Xi Jinping, it’s less glorious than dangerous.

Beijing plans to establish a Central Financial Commission, which will act as a watchdog, decision-maker, and regulator for the country’s $61 trillion financial sector, the Financial Times reported. Keep in mind: China already has a state securities regulatory commission.

Never Bounced Back

China didn’t experience the pandemic rebound seen by other developed nations. Today, unemployment among young workers is growing, exports are in a slump, and investor confidence is dwindling. Plus, the country’s tech sector is facing heavy sanctions from the US and EU.

But China’s biggest financial woes lie in the real estate industry, a formerly booming sector and job creator that has fallen into disarray in the past two years after Beijing placed borrowing limits on real estate firms. New home prices are falling, a glut of apartments sit vacant, and major developers such as Evergrande and Country Garden — formerly gold standards for property managers — face hundreds of billions of dollars in debt.

Now, Xi feels it’s time for the Communist Party (CCP) to make things right:

The Central Financial Commission intends to address China’s economic troubles by placing Xi and the CCP as the de facto leaders of the country’s financial sector, while weakening established government groups such as the People’s Bank of China and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

With the extended control, the CCP could deleverage the real estate sector, shore up the finances of indebted local governments, and clamp down on speculation and corruption, the FT reported. It would also place Xi and the party at the head of major business deals such as mergers and joint ventures.

“The line between the party and the government has become decisively blurred, so there is no way that the new financial watchdogs will contradict with what the party wants,” Yan Wang of global investment firm Alpine Macro, told Reuters in March when the commission was first announced.

Safe and secure: In recent months, Xi and the CCP have become obsessed with national security and party control while the economy has taken a back seat. Authorities have raided the offices of foreign businesses, and state broadcasters have accused Western countries of trying to steal sensitive information from important Chinese businesses. A new national watchdog is essentially the latest move to de-westernize China’s economy and extend the CCP’s influence.","Under President Xi Jinping, China is attempting to address its economic woes by creating a Central Financial Commission, which will act as a watchdog, decision-maker, and regulator for its $61 trillion financial sector. This move would give the Communist Party de facto control over the country's finances in order to deleverage the real estate sector, shore up local government finances, and clamp down on speculation and corruption."
2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,"Israel Hamas war: Israeli tanks hit Gaza, settler attacks in ... - Yahoo",https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-hamas-war-israeli-tanks-052820045.html,"Israeli tanks raid Gaza

Israel's army says it has carried out an operation in northern Gaza in preparation for the next stages of combat.

In a post on social media site X, it said IDF tanks and infantry struck ""numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile posts.""

Soldiers are said to have returned to Israeli territory.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed his country was preparing a ground invasion of Gaza, and that ""we are working against the clock"" in preparations to destroy Hamas.

""We are in a war for our sovereignty, for our existence, and we have set ourselves two fundamental objectives: to eradicate Hamas's military and governmental capabilities and to do everything possible to bring the hostages held by the Palestinian Islamist group back home,"" Netanyahu said in a televised address.

UN fails to pass resolution on Israel Hamas war - again

The UN Security Council has failed to address the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, rejecting rival United States and Russian resolutions.

ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement

Washington's resolution reaffirmed Israel’s right to self-defence, urged respect for international laws — especially protection of civilians — and called for “humanitarian pauses” to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza.

10 countries on the 15-member council voted in favour, three were against and two abstained. The resolution was not adopted because Russia and China cast vetoes.

The Russian resolution called for an immediate “humanitarian cease-fire"", and unequivocally condemned Hamas’ 7 October attack on southern Israel and “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians in Gaza.

Four countries voted in favour, two against and nine abstained. The resolution did not pass because it failed to get the minimum nine “yes” votes.

Under UN charter, the Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace. But Wednesday’s votes, following the rejections last week of a Russian resolution and Brazilian proposal, leave the council divided and paralyzed over the Israel-Hamas war.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of submitting its text with no consultations and “in bad faith.” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called Washington's draft a “politicised” proposal to shore up Israel.

A compromise resolution could be drafted.

Biden condemns attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank

The US President spoke out against retaliatory attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank in the aftermath of Hamas's surprise assault on 7 October.

Joe Biden said the attacks by “extremist settlers” were ""pouring gasoline"" on already raging fires in the Middle East since the attack, which killed 1,400 people.

“It has to stop. They have to be held accountable. It has to stop now,” he said at the start of a news conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who was visiting Washington.

Settler violence against Palestinians has intensified in recent weeks, with Palestinians killed by settlers.

Rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing them to evacuate to other areas.

The violence threatens to open another front in the two-week-old war, which has already split into other areas, including southern Lebanon and Syria.

It also puts pressure on the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, though is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in large part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters.

The West Bank Protection Consortium, a coalition of nongovernmental organisations and donor countries, including the European Union, says hundreds of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced in the West Bank due to settler violence since 7 October.

That’s on top of the more than 1,100 displaced since 2022.

Fighting could threaten already fragile Middle Eastern economies

Economic crises are rippling through countries bordering Israel, raising the possibility of a chain reaction from the war with Hamas.

The fallout could further worsen the financial health and political stability of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon and create problems beyond.

All three countries face differing economic pressures that led the International Monetary Fund to warn in September that their ""sociopolitical stability"" was at risk.

That warning came shortly before the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas, which could easily cause economic chaos.

The possible fallout is now starting to be recognised by world leaders and policy analysts.

For a Biden administration committed to stopping the Israel-Hamas war from widening, the conflict could amplify the economic strains and possibly cause governments to collapse.

If the chaos went unchecked, it could spread across a region that is vital for global oil supplies - with reverberations around the globe.

“The more unstable things are economically, the easier it is for bad actors in the region to stir the pot,"" said Christopher Swift, an international lawyer and former Treasury Department official.

""The notion that you can divorce politics from economics is a little bit myopic, and naive. Politics, economics and security go together very closely.”

France's Macron pushes for coalition to fight Hamas

French President Emmanuel Macron is promoting, with little success so far, an international coalition to fight the armed Palestinian group Hamas.

He pitched the idea during a two-day trip to the Middle East that started in Israel.

Leaders he met with in Israel, the West Bank, Jordan and Egypt didn’t publicly address the issue.

The first response to the devastating Israel-Hamas war is “the fight against terrorism,” Macron said Wednesday after his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.

“The right response is to cooperate, to draw lessons from the international coalition against the Islamic State group” that intervened in Iraq and Syria, he added.

Macron first proposed the idea Tuesday after his meeting with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mentioning a “regional and international coalition” against Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip.

Netanyahu did not specifically comment on the proposal.","ern attacked by Israeli settlers since the start of the war.Israeli tanks have raided Gaza in preparation for the next stages of combat, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirming his country's right to self-defense and goal to ""eradicate Hamas's military and governmental capabilities."" The UN Security Council has failed to pass both a US and Russian resolution attempting to address the conflict, and in the West Bank, US President Joe Biden has condemned attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians."

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) assuming dilution was $1.86 for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.13 for the third quarter of 2023. The increases in GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter versus the prior year were primarily due to operational strength in the business, as well as $0.22 of charges recorded in 2022 related to collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Inc. (Moderna), Orna Therapeutics (Orna) and Orion Corporation (Orion). The increase in GAAP EPS in the third quarter of 2023 was also driven by the impacts of intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2022, compared with no such charges recorded in 2023, and lower losses from investments in equity securities in 2023. The increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.

Non-GAAP EPS excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, as well as income and losses from investments in equity securities.

Year-to-date results can be found in the attached tables.

GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information

Gross margin was 73.3% for the third quarter of 2023 compared with 73.7% for the third quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher LAGEVRIO sales, which have a low gross margin, and higher acquisition- and divestiture-related costs. The gross margin decline was partially offset by lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements, lower manufacturing-related costs and the favorable impact of product mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $2.5 billion in both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, primarily reflecting increased promotional spending, offset by lower administrative costs.

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $4.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to charges recorded in 2022 of $887 million for intangible asset impairments, largely related to nemtabrutinib, and $690 million for collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion. The decrease in R&D expenses was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs in 2023, reflecting in part increased headcount, higher investments in discovery research and early drug development and higher clinical development spending.

Other (income) expense, net, was $126 million of expense in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $429 million of expense in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net losses from investments in equity securities.

The effective tax rate was 15.5% for the third quarter of 2023 compared with 9.2% in the third quarter of 2022.

GAAP EPS was $1.86 for the third quarter of 2023 compared with $1.28 for the third quarter of 2022.

Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information

Non-GAAP gross margin was 77.0% for both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, and higher LAGEVRIO sales, which have a low gross margin, offset by lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements, lower manufacturing-related costs and the favorable impact of product mix.

Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.5 billion in both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, primarily reflecting increased promotional spending, offset by lower administrative costs.

Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to charges of $690 million in 2022 related to collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion. The decrease in R&D expenses was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs in 2023, reflecting in part increased headcount, higher investments in discovery research and early drug development and higher clinical development spending.

Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $133 million of expense in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $105 million of expense in the third quarter of 2022.

The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.0% for the third quarter of 2023 compared with 13.6% in the third quarter of 2022.

Non-GAAP EPS was $2.13 for the third quarter of 2023 compared with $1.85 for the third quarter of 2022.

Pipeline and Portfolio Highlights

Merck continued to achieve regulatory and clinical milestones across its expansive pipeline and portfolio. The company is initiating Phase 3 trials in 2023 in multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiometabolic and immunology, and in new modalities. These include investigational individualized neoantigen therapy V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) MK-2870 and lysine-specific demethylase-1 inhibitor MK-3543 in oncology, oral PCSK9 inhibitor candidate MK-0616 in cardiovascular, and humanized monoclonal antibody MK-7240 in immunology.

In oncology, the company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment, the company’s eighth approval of KEYTRUDA in earlier-stage cancer. The FDA also granted priority review to two supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDAs): for WELIREG in certain previously treated patients with advanced RCC, and for KEYTRUDA in cervical cancer. Notably, Merck presented compelling new data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023 that showcased the company’s progress in earlier stages of cancers, its foundational position in metastatic disease and continued momentum in its diverse oncology pipeline.

In cardiovascular disease, Merck received priority review from the FDA for a new Biologics License Application (BLA) for sotatercept, the company’s novel investigational activin signaling inhibitor for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization Group 1), based on clinically meaningful results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of March 26, 2024. If approved, sotatercept would be the first in its class, bringing a novel approach to address a rare and progressive disease of the pulmonary arteries. Merck’s submission for sotatercept to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in the European Union (EU) has also been completed.

Additionally, Merck entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for three potentially first-in-class clinical-stage DXd ADCs for the treatment of multiple solid tumors, both as monotherapy and/or in combination with other treatments. This collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo will further augment and diversify Merck’s oncology pipeline.

Sustainability Highlights

Merck issued its 2022/2023 Impact Report highlighting the company’s performance across its sustainability efforts, reflecting strong progress toward its commitments to advance access to health and operate responsibly. The report noted how the company reached more than 500 million people around the world with its innovations in 2022 and expanded two of its 2025 Access to Health goals.

Full-Year 2023 Financial Outlook

The following table summarizes the company’s full-year financial outlook.

Full Year 2023 Updated Prior Sales* $59.7 to $60.2 billion $58.6 to $59.6 billion Non-GAAP Gross margin2 Approximately 77% Approximately 77% Non-GAAP Operating expenses2** $39.8 to $40.4 billion $34.0 to $34.6 billion Non-GAAP Other (income) expense, net2 Approximately $200 million Approximately $100 million Non-GAAP Effective tax rate2*** 39.0% to 40.0% 30.5% to 31.5% Non-GAAP EPS2**** $1.33 to $1.38 $2.95 to $3.05 Share count (assuming dilution) 2.55 billion 2.55 billion *Includes approximately $1.3 billion of LAGEVRIO sales. The company does not have any non-GAAP adjustments to sales. **Includes an aggregate $17.1 billion of R&D expenses related to the Prometheus Biosciences, Inc. (Prometheus) and Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago) acquisitions, and upfront payments for the license and collaboration agreement with Kelun-Biotech (a holding subsidiary of Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) and collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo. Outlook does not assume any additional significant potential business development transactions. ***Includes an approximate 24.5 percentage point negative impact related to business development (Imago, Prometheus and Daiichi Sankyo). ****Includes $6.22 of one-time charges related to the Prometheus and Imago acquisitions and upfront payments to Kelun-Biotech and Daiichi Sankyo.

Merck has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, given it cannot predict with reasonable certainty the amounts necessary for such a reconciliation, including intangible asset impairment charges, legal settlements, and income and losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in investment funds, without unreasonable effort. These items are inherently difficult to forecast and could have a significant impact on the company’s future GAAP results.

Merck continues to experience strong sustained demand for key growth products, particularly in oncology and vaccines. As a result, Merck is raising and narrowing its full-year sales outlook. Merck now expects full-year sales to be between $59.7 billion and $60.2 billion, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2 percentage points, at mid-October 2023 exchange rates. This full-year outlook includes approximately $1.3 billion of LAGEVRIO sales.

Merck’s full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be between 39.0% and 40.0%, which includes an approximate 24.5 percentage point negative impact related to business development activity.

Merck now expects its full-year non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.33 and $1.38, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 6 percentage points, at mid-October 2023 exchange rates. This revised non-GAAP EPS range reflects the following, which were not previously included in the outlook:

Additional strength in the business of approximately $0.15 per share.

A pretax charge of $5.5 billion, or $1.70 per share, for the collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo.

Estimated expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 of approximately $0.04 per share to advance the ADC assets and finance the transaction with Daiichi Sankyo.

A 1%, or approximately $0.05 per share, incremental negative impact of foreign exchange.

The non-GAAP EPS range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, income and losses from investments in equity securities, and a previously disclosed charge related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Red Sox hire ex-pitcher Breslow as new chief baseball officer,https://sports.yahoo.com/red-sox-hire-ex-pitcher-024157295.html,"Boston Red Sox hire Craig Breslow

The Boston Red Sox have hired ex-pitcher Craig Breslow as their new chief baseball officer, the team announced Wednesday.

Breslow pitched for Boston in 2006 and again from 2012-15. Since 2019, he has worked in the Cubs front office, serving most recently as an assistant general manager. Boston said in its statement that Breslow will be responsible for all baseball operations matters.

He is the second straight Yale graduate to lead the Red Sox baseball operations department. Chaim Bloom, who was the first person to hold the chief baseball officer title for the Red Sox, was fired in September after presiding over three last-place finishes in four seasons. Now, Breslow will assume the same title Bloom held.

“I couldn’t be more excited to return to the Boston Red Sox, an organization that means so much to my family and to me,” Breslow said in a statement. “I know firsthand how special winning in Boston is, and I look forward to once again experiencing that passion and success with our fans.”

The Red Sox hope Breslow’s tenure will be more like another Yalie, Theo Epstein, who built the teams that snapped the franchise’s 86-year World Series drought, winning it all in 2004 and again in 2007.

Bloom was unable to match him. He was fired with three weeks left in the season, before the start of a Sept. 14 doubleheader against the rival Yankees. With a loss in the night game, the Red Sox dropped into a tie for last place in the AL East; they never got out of the cellar, finishing fifth for the third time in four seasons.

“Each year, one baseball club emerges with a championship,” Red Sox principal owner John Henry said in a statement. “Our organization continues to have significantly high standards and expectations with a goal of being able to compete annually for that coveted privilege. After the 2018 World Series, we sought to build a future that would avoid the ups and downs normally associated with winning. That plainly hasn’t happened.""

Henry said Breslow's understanding of the game made him “the right person at the right time to lead out baseball department.”

“What convinced us to bring him aboard in this capacity was his highly strategic philosophy and his grasp of what it takes operationally in today’s evolving game to excel at the highest level in player acquisition, development, and execution at the major league level,” Henry said. ""We are excited to welcome him back.”

Bloom was hired from the Tampa Bay Rays to help revive the farm system and bring financial stability to a team that was one of baseball’s biggest spenders. One of his first moves was to trade 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts, a year before he was eligible for free agency, on a mandate from ownership to get the payroll in order.

The return for Betts was unspectacular - outfielder Alex Verdugo and some prospects that have not panned out - and other moves have failed to yield results at the major league level. Bloom also watched shortstop Xander Bogaerts, whom the organization developed into a four-time All-Star, depart as a free agent.

In all, the Red Sox were 267-262 in Bloom’s tenure, with a trip to the AL Championship Series in 2021.

The search for his replacement was complicated by the team’s commitment to manager Alex Cora. The former infielder who led Boston to a franchise-record 108 regular-season victories and a World Series title in 2018 announced on his own that he will be back for 2024, a signal to candidates that they will have to share power with the bench boss.

The Red Sox also committed to other members of the front office, promoting general manager Brian O’Halloran to executive vice president of baseball operations even before a head of the department had been chosen. Assistant general managers Eddie Romero, Raquel Ferreira and Michael Groopman also remained on board.

The murky power structure reportedly turned off several potential hires, who withdrew their names from consideration for the position.

Although the Red Sox have been the most successful team in the majors this century, winning four World Series after going 86 years without even one, Breslow is the fifth different baseball boss since the ownership group led by John Henry took over in 2002.

The fact that Epstein (2004, ’07), Ben Cherington (’13) and Dave Dombrowski (’18) all left on bad terms despite building championship-winning teams was also said to scare off some potential successors.

Kennedy insisted he was not worried.

“At the end of the day, this is the Boston Red Sox,” he said the day after the season ended. “If you want to run a baseball organization, this is where you want to be. You want to be in Boston.

“Why? Because it matters here more than anywhere else,” he said. “If you’re not up for that challenge? Thanks, but no thanks.""","ital candidates, who wanted to be the clear head of baseball operations with authority over Cora.

“Our third-quarter results reflect decisive steps we took to aggressively reduce inventories and prioritize strong cash generation,” said Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO. “We delivered this strong cash flow against a backdrop of persistently weak demand and continued inventory destocking across several of our key end markets. We are encouraged to see modest improvements in demand across some markets, including consumer durables and personal care, but the pace of recovery has been slower than expected. We continue to focus on controllable actions, including maintaining cost discipline, defending the value of our products with resilient pricing, and managing working capital. These actions contribute to my confidence in the resiliency of our portfolio and sustainability of our strong cash flow going forward. We are also incredibly excited to be on track for producing material and realizing revenue from our Kingsport, Tennessee, methanolysis facility around the end of the year, further positioning Eastman as a leader in the circular economy.”

Corporate Results 3Q 2023 versus 3Q 2022

Sales revenue decreased 16 percent due to 11 percent lower sales volume/mix and 5 percent lower selling prices.

Sales volume/mix was lower across most product lines due to the continuation of weak primary demand and continued customer inventory destocking across several end markets, including consumer durables, building and construction, agriculture, and medical. Lower selling prices in Chemical Intermediates and Additives & Functional Products more than offset higher selling prices in Fibers.

EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume/mix, lower capacity utilization to drive cash generation, increased pension expense, as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign currency. These factors were partially offset by lower variable costs more than offsetting lower selling prices and benefits from cost reduction actions.

Segment Results 3Q 2023 versus 3Q 2022

Advanced Materials – Sales revenue was down 16 percent due to 17 percent lower sales volume/mix.

While specialty plastics end-market demand improved compared to second quarter 2023, sales volume/mix was 26 percent lower compared to third quarter 2022 as the business recovers from weak demand and aggressive customer inventory destocking, particularly in the consumer durables, medical, and consumables end markets.

EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume/mix, significantly lower capacity utilization to drive cash generation, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency. These factors were partially offset by the continued flow through of lower variable costs.

Additives & Functional Products – Sales revenue decreased 26 percent primarily due to 18 percent lower sales volume/mix and 9 percent lower selling prices.

Sales volume/mix was lower across the segment due to weak demand, especially in the building and construction end market, as well as aggressive customer inventory destocking in the agriculture end market. Lower selling prices were primarily due to cost-pass-through contracts.

EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume/mix and lower capacity utilization to drive cash generation, partially offset by lower variable costs more than offsetting lower selling prices.

Fibers – Sales revenue increased 29 percent primarily due to 28 percent higher selling prices.

Substantially higher selling prices for acetate tow were due to an increase in industry capacity utilization and higher raw material, energy, and distribution prices throughout 2022.

EBIT increased due to recovery of margins as higher selling prices returned EBIT margins to acceptable performance levels.

Chemical Intermediates – Sales revenue decreased 21 percent due to 19 percent lower selling prices and 2 percent lower sales volume/mix.

Lower selling prices and sales volume/mix, particularly for olefins, were primarily due to weak end-market demand.

EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume/mix, lower capacity utilization, and lower spreads.

Cash Flow

In third quarter 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $514 million compared to $256 million in third quarter 2022. The strong increase compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by a substantial reduction of inventories. In third quarter 2023, the company returned $94 million to stockholders through dividends. See Table 5. Priorities for uses of available cash for 2023 include organic growth investments, payment of the quarterly dividend, bolt-on acquisitions, share repurchases to offset dilution, and net debt reduction.

2023 Outlook

Commenting on the outlook for full-year 2023, Costa said: “Despite the continued challenging global economic environment, we were able to deliver on our earnings and cash flow expectations for the third quarter. This performance was the result of disciplined pricing across the portfolio, strong results in the Fibers segment, and decisive actions to generate strong cash flow. We also remain on track to reduce our cost structure by a total of $200 million for the year, net of inflation. As we enter the fourth quarter, demand remains muted as customers are cautious in the current challenging environment. We are also expecting normal seasonality in key end markets, including building and construction, consumer durables, and performance films automotive applications. And we will continue our decisive actions to generate cash. Taking this together, we expect 2023 EPS to be between $6.30 and $6.50, and for 2023 operating cash flow to approach $1.4 billion.”

The full-year 2023 projected adjusted diluted EPS excludes any non-core, unusual, or nonrecurring items. Our financial results forecasts do not include non-core items (such as mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefit gain or loss, and asset impairments and restructuring charges) or any unusual or non-recurring items because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the financial impact of such items.

Spencer Moen has been in custody since last summer, when he was charged in the death of his wife, Sonja Moen, whose body was found in a West Fargo home the morning of Aug. 10.

According to the murder charge, Spencer Moen intentionally or knowingly caused the death of his wife or willfully caused her death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.

Court documents that accompany the Class AA felony charge of intentional murder state that around 7:38 a.m. on Aug. 10, West Fargo police

responded to a call regarding a woman who was not breathing at a home

in the 1100 block of Eaglewood Avenue West.

The documents also allege that:

Officers spoke to the caller, Spencer Moen, who was 31 at the time. Moen told officers his wife, Sonja, had slept in the bathtub the night before and was unresponsive.

Officers found Sonja Moen's body fully clothed in the bathtub. She had significant bruising on the left side of her face and forehead, and both of her eyes appeared swollen and shut.

She also had bruising on the backs of her hands, which appeared to be defensive wounds, according to court documents.

Officers also noticed bruising on Spencer Moen's right hand in the knuckle area.

Shortly after arriving, first responders pronounced Sonja Moen dead at the scene.

During an interview with police, Spencer Moen said he and his wife were both intoxicated when they got home the night before from a visit to Mapleton.

Police determined that Spencer Moen had been golfing in Mapleton and that his wife picked him up after it was dark. Based on witness statements, the couple would have arrived home around 10 p.m.

When police asked Spencer Moen about injuries to his wife's face, he told police she tripped on steps leading from the garage to the house and ""face planted.""

Spencer Moen also told police he and his wife argued after getting home and that during a physical altercation, his wife punched him several times.

He said he then punched his wife several times, at which point he said his wife told him she was going to take a shower before going into the bathroom.

Spencer Moen told police that after a time, he went into the bathroom and saw his wife in the bathtub. He said she was alive and making noises but wasn't talking.

He said he dumped water over her head to get her attention, but she didn't respond and remained in the tub.

He said he then went to bed and fell asleep.

Spencer Moen said when he woke up later, he found his wife still in the bathtub and cold to the touch.

He said he then took their children to their day care provider.

Upon returning home, he said, his wife was still unresponsive, so he called his mother-in-law to say Sonja Moen was not waking up, and he didn't think she was breathing. He then called 911.

Court documents say Sonja Moen's oldest daughter called her mother's phone the night of Aug. 9, and during one call at 10:41 p.m., Spencer Moen answered his wife's phone.

The daughter told police his voice sounded irritated, and she could hear Sonja Moen in the background snoring.

According to court documents, a video on Spencer Moen's phone taken at 11:37 p.m. Aug. 9 showed Sonja Moen lying in the bathtub in the opposite direction of the position she was in when first responders found her.

In the video, it appears she is having extreme difficulty breathing and exhibiting a sound similar to snoring.

An investigator noted that the sound appeared to be consistent with ""agonal breathing,"" a term for when someone who is not getting enough oxygen is gasping for air.

Court documents note Spencer Moen did not make any attempt to intervene or provide care to his wife while filming the video.

Preliminary autopsy findings indicated Sonja Moen suffered from a subdural hematoma and died from blunt-force trauma to her head. She suffered at least one fractured rib.

If found guilty of the murder charge, Spencer Moen faces a maximum of life in prison without parole.

He also faces a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the deprivation or delinquency of two minors.

On Wednesday, he also pleaded not guilty to that charge.

Also on Wednesday, Spencer Moen's attorney Stormy Vickers asked Judge Nicholas Chase to modify conditions for release that had been set for him in August, when the court stated he could be released only if he posted $1 million cash.

Vickers asked Chase to consider setting conditions for release at $750,000, cash or bond, or amend the original conditions of release to $1 million cash or bond.

Chase said he would let the original conditions of release stand.

Moen's next court appearance is set for Jan. 10, 2024.","-psy results indicate Sonja Moen died of asphyxia due to smothering, and her death was ruled a homicide.Spencer Moen has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge of his wife, Sonja Moen, after her body was found in a West Fargo home in August.

(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors are urging a judge to reinstate a gag order on Donald Trump, citing recent social media posts about the former president's chief of staff that they said represented an attempt to influence and intimidate a foreseeable witness in the case.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the federal case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, last week temporarily paused her order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments about prosecutors, court staff and potential witnesses. The ruling came as Trump's lawyers challenge the limited gag order in higher courts.

In a motion filed Wednesday night, special counsel Jack Smith's team encouraged Chutkan to put the restrictions back in place. Prosecutors cited in part statements in social media and at a news conference over the last day by Trump about his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who was reported by ABC News on Tuesday to have testified before a grand jury after receiving immunity from prosecution.

The former president mused on social media about the possibility that Meadows, a close ally in the White House who was charged alongside Trump in a separate state prosecution in Georgia related to efforts to undo the election, would give testimony to Smith in exchange for immunity. One part of the post said: “Some people would make that deal, but they are weaklings and cowards, and so bad for the future our Failing Nation. I don't think that Mark Meadows is one of them but who really knows?""

In their motion, Smith's team cited the post about Meadows as an example of the type of commentary that the original gag order was meant to prohibit and a reason why the restrictions should be reinstated.

Trump, prosecutors wrote, has “capitalized on the Court’s administrative stay to, among other prejudicial conduct, send an unmistakable and threatening message to a foreseeable witness in this case.”

They added: “Unless the Court lifts the administrative stay, the defendant will not stop his harmful and prejudicial attacks. In addition, to the extent that the defendant’s public message — directed to the Chief of Staff, with knowledge that it would reach him — is not already covered by his release conditions, it is an intentional end-run around them.”

Smith's team also asked Chutkan to modify the conditions of Trump's pretrial release by making compliance with the gag order a condition, or by “clarifying that the existing condition barring communication with witnesses about the facts of the case includes indirect messages to witnesses made publicly on social media or in speeches.”

In a separate matter Wednesday, Trump was fined $10,000 after the judge in his civil fraud trial in New York said the former president had violated a gag order.","Prosecutors have requested a judge to reinstate a gag order on former President Donald Trump, citing recent social media posts about his former chief of staff as an attempt to intimidate a potential witness in the case.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)

ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) — Hurricane Otis tore across Mexico’s southern Pacific coast as a powerful and dangerous Category 5 hurricane Wednesday, unleashing massive flooding in the resort city of Acapulco and setting off looting as desperate relatives tired of waiting for help to arrive.

While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — Acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late Wednesday — experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast.

Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after Hurricane Otis blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of hotel windows.

Choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the Pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting.

The hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by Wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake.

Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. “We laid down on the floor and some between beds,” Sauczuk said. “We prayed a lot.”

One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess.

He complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel.

Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room.

“I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held,” said Navarro. “But there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors.”

Navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricane's rapid intensification.

He stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mud-choked streets outside.

“This is out of control, “ he said.

Acapulco's Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water.

Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement.

While much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK.

Alicia Galindo, a 28-year-old stylist in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosí, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. Her parents and brother were staying in Acapulco’s Hotel Princess for an international mining conference when Otis hit.

They told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when ""windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down ... until everything was gone,” she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said.

However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel.

“Everybody is trying to find something out ... but no one knows anything,"" she said anxiously.

The main highway into Acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of Wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. By late Wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced.

Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside Acapulco on Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck.

The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out.

“We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay.” Campos said.

On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one.

“It’s one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you’re expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you’re not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,” said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami.

Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been “completely lost.""

Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the city’s hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca.

Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, López Obrador said. Mexico’s Secretary of National Defense told the AP on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. Officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service.

López Obrador noted that Otis was a stronger hurricane than Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people.

Key takeaways:

Patients reported a substantial amount of financial burden after an orthopedic trauma injury.

Results showed 10% and 30% of patients reported a high degree of financial burden and worry, respectively.

SEATTLE — Patients with orthopedic trauma injuries may experience financial burden and worry associated with their injury regardless of insurance, employment status or access to paid leave, according to results presented here.

“As orthopedic surgeons, we need to look out for patients suffering from financial distress following their injury and mobilize what resources you do have access to, to help improve their overall experience,” Devon T. Brameier, BMBCh, BSc, said in her presentation at the Orthopaedic Trauma Association Annual Meeting.

Data were derived from Brameier DT, et al. Paper 92. Presented at: Orthopaedic Trauma Association Annual Meeting; Oct. 18-21, 2023; Seattle.

Substantial financial burden

To identify the potential risks and protective factors for financial distress related to orthopedic trauma, Brameier and colleagues collected surveys from 127 patients undergoing surgery for an orthopedic trauma injury at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Brameier said the surveys included the financial burden composite (FBC) score and the dichotomized worry (DW) score.

Devon T. Brameier

“The FBC score is a validated score on a scale of zero to six, with a score greater than four [being] indicative of high financial burden, while the DW score is a validated score on a zero to 100 scale, with a score greater than 60 indicating high degrees of financial burden,” Brameier said.

Researchers found 99% of patients had some form of medical insurance and 50% of patients were employed at the time of injury. Of those, 62% of patients had access to paid medical leave. Brameier also said 13% of patients had preexisting medical debt, defined as having debt of at least $1,000.

“Patients reported a substantial amount of financial burden at 3, 6 and 12 months,” Brameier said. “The degree of financial burden they reported is similar to previous studies investigating patients with new diagnoses of cancer and recent heart attacks, and we did see there was no change in this burden through the entire year time course.”

Worry scores may decrease

According to Brameier, about 33% of patients had to use savings due to their injury; about 11% of patients had to borrow money, take out a loan or were unable to make bill payments; and about 10% of patients did not attend physical therapy appointments due to the financial burden from their injury. She added 10% of patients reported a high degree of financial burden and 30% of patients reported high degrees of worry related to their financial well-being because of their injury at 3 months. Although financial burden scores showed a nonsignificant trend of decreasing with time, Brameier said the DW score had a significant decrease by the 12-month mark.

“We found age was strongly negatively correlated with financial burden and moderately negatively correlated with financial worry. Our retired patients reported significantly less financial burden and worry than our employed patients at the time of injury,” Brameier said. “We also found that the strongest predictor of financial burden and worry was having had preexisting medical debt of at least $1,000 and factors such as insurance status, education and access to paid sick leave were not protected against this financial burden.”

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,China Speeds Up Replacement of Western PCs and Other Tech,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/china-speeds-up-replacement-of-western-pcs-and-other-tech,"China is speeding up its efforts to lessen reliance on foreign technologies, focusing on nurturing and implementing domestic alternatives, according to Reuters. This strategic shift has been influenced by the tightening restrictions from U.S. government on high-tech exports to China. The initiative has seen a surge in government, military, and state-linked entities pushing for an accelerated adoption of domestic PCs, telecommunication equipment, and software.

Hundreds of Billions in the Game

In 2022, China allocated ¥1.4 trillion (equivalent to $191 billion) towards the substitution of foreign hardware and software with domestic alternatives, representing a 16.2% increase compared to the previous year, as per insights from the IT research entity, First New Voice.

The number of payments and bids aimed at nationalizing equipment used by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has seen a two-fold increase, rising from 119 to 235 from September 2022 to September 2023, Reuters found out from finance ministry database. The value of projects awarded during this period has also tripled, reaching a total of ¥156.9 million ($21.448 million). Although only capturing a fraction of the national tender bids, the database stands as the most extensive public repository of state tenders, furthermore, it corroborates with information from independent third-party sources (e.g., research documents), the news agency notes.

Replacing Hardware and Software

A significant portion of China's shift initiative is directed towards computer hardware, aiming to supplant foreign-branded machines and components with locally developed and manufactured ones. The telecommunications industry is also under scrutiny, with plans underway to transition towards domestic technologies, minimizing the reliance on Western companies. Additionally, there is an effort to revamp sensitive infrastructural systems, such as usage of domestic intelligence-gathering equipment.

China is strategizing to overhaul various software sectors with homegrown solutions too. Office software systems used by state enterprises are earmarked for replacement with local versions, aligning with directives to enhance domestic utilization. Financial technologies, particularly those governing digital transactions and banking databases, are also slated for a revamp, fostering a transition towards domestic software to bolster security and autonomy.

Huawei has emerged as a main player in China's technological transformation, witnessing a substantial growth in its enterprise business sector, which encompasses software and cloud computing services. In 2022, Huawei's enterprise business reported sales amounting to ¥133 billion ($18.181 billion), marking a 30% increase from the previous year. The company's comprehensive range of products and its agility in product deployment are the key factors contributing to its thrive in China despite being sanctioned by the U.S. government.

China Faces Challenges

Despite the vigorous push towards domestic technology, China faces significant challenges, primarily attributed to its limited capabilities in advanced chip manufacturing. This limitation hinders the country's ability to fully realize a comprehensive substitution of foreign technologies with domestic counterparts. Additionally, sectors such as financial institutions have exhibited reluctance in transitioning towards domestic database systems, citing stability and reliability concerns.","China is accelerating its efforts to reduce its reliance on foreign technologies, focusing on nurturing and implementing domestic alternatives. Government, military, and state-linked entities are pushing for an accelerated adoption of domestic PCs, telecommunication equipment, and software. Billions of dollars have been allocated towards replacing foreign hardware and software, although challenges remain with regards to capability and reliability."

Centene, the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country, is down over one million members since March, according to CFO Drew Asher during the company's third quarter earnings call on Tuesday.

The loss of 1.1 million Medicaid members is due to the Medicaid redetermination process that began on April 1. The numbers are on track with Centene's forecast, Asher said.

From April through August, Centene experienced rejoining rates in the mid 20% range. Importantly, the 90-day grace period in most states means that the majority of these members had no break in coverage as they returned to the Medicaid program, the company said.

Centene said its view of 2024 Medicaid performance is unchanged other than revenue looking to be a little stronger than the $77 billion the company outlined during its first quarter call.

""... We have not changed our view that the ultimate impact of redeterminations would be 2.3 million to 2.4 million members,"" CEO Sarah London said. ""We continue to track in line with our expected 200,000 to 300,000 members moving from Medicaid into (the) marketplace as a result of the redetermination's process. Overall, we are encouraged by the progress that states are making with respect to Medicaid redeterminations and pleased to be moving through the process with operational stability and results that are consistent with our modeling.""

Growth includes North Carolina becoming the 41st state to expand Medicaid. This will go live in December, according to London.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has played an important role with respect to the oversight of the Medicaid redeterminations process, London said, including the recent intervention to pause redeterminations in certain states as well as the effort to reinstate children and individuals who were incorrectly dropped from coverage due to system issues.

Based on recent actions by CMS and ongoing conversations with state partners, Centene expects the overwhelming majority of redeterminations will be completed by May 2024.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Much of the company's business is in managed care, serving vulnerable populations.

Centene has 13.4 billion members in traditional Medicaid, compared to 14 billion in 2022, according to its earnings statement.

This compares to Medicare, in which the company has 1.3 million members and another 4.5 million in Medicare with a prescription drug plan.

The recently released Georgia request for proposal includes for the first time the state's aged blind and disabled population, the company said.

""As we look ahead to our procurement pipeline we feel good about the opportunity to leverage our incumbent position and our differentiated depth of expertise in managing complex populations to defend and grow our Medicaid footprint,"" London said.

In support of this work, Centene has appointed Wade Rakes as chief growth officer.

Centene's adjusted net earnings for the three months ending September 30 were $1 billion compared to $755 million during the same quarter in 2022.

Revenues from Medicaid rose 2% year over year while Medicare revenues fell 4% year over year and commercial revenues jumped 50% year over year, according to Yahoo Finance.

Centene announced the $1.2 billion divestiture of Circle Health, a U.K. hospital company. The deal is expected to close during the first quarter of next year.

Affordable Care Act marketplace membership exceeded 3.6 million members as of September 30, compared to 2.1 million during the same quarter last year.

""Strong fundamentals and excellent marketplace growth and performance contributed to the strength in the quarter, as well as our improved outlook for 2023,"" London said.

THE LARGER TREND

Medicare Advantage star ratings has been a challenge for Centene, which saw four of its Wellcare plans get a 2-star rating earlier this month.

In the 1-5 Medicare Advantage star ratings released by CMS each year, these four plans were the only ones to receive the lowest ranking of 2 stars.

Medicare open enrollment opened on October 15.

""The final stars results for this cycle were consistent with our July and September commentary, where we expected two thirds of our membership associated with contracts showing year-over-year raw score improvement. That result was approximately 73%,"" London said. ""We also said we are expecting roughly 90% of our membership to be associated with contracts rated 3 stars or higher, and that final result was 87%.""

She added, ""While we delivered star results in line with our Q2 expectations, these results certainly do not reflect the ambition of this organization. Medicare Advantage remains an integral part of our portfolio of businesses, strategically aligned with our Medicaid and marketplace platforms and a long-term driver of both earnings and growth.""

Centene last month announced it would by laying off about 2,000 employees, representing about 3% of its total workforce, after it reported a $213 million net earnings loss to end 2022, although it saw a 9% increase in revenue, driven by organic Medicaid growth and a 21% increase in membership in its Medicare business.

[END OF PREVIEW]

Financial Markets, Institutions, And TransactionsFinancial markets can be described as marketplaces in which sellers and buyers are engaged in buying and selling commodities, currencies, equities, and derivatives. These transactions are carried out based on efficient market prices, which indicate overall projections about the future by every investor. Trade in financial markets and institutions are also based on basic trading regulations, market forces, and costs. Since these markets can be found in nearly every part of the globe, they are classified as domestic or international financial markets. Notably, some of the current financial markets are accessible to private investors whereas others are specifically for major global banks and professionals in finance. Moreover, there are several types of financial markets with varying types of transactions supported by the different economies across the globe.Capital Markets:One of the most common types of financial markets is capital markets, which is characterized with different types of transactions across economies. These markets primarily involve the trade of securities by individuals and financial institutions. While organizations usually sell securities in order to raise funds, capital markets are made up of primary and secondary markets. Primary markets are a marketplace where newly issued stocks and bonds are exchanged while secondary market involves the trade of existing bonds and stocks. Download full

paper NOW! ⬇️ Financial transactions in capital markets occur when trading securities i.e. stocks and bonds and are supervised by financial regulatory bodies (""Capital Market Transactions,"" 2013). Therefore, the financial transactions in a typical capital market involves the buying and selling of bonds and stocks. As previously mentioned, these markets serve as the ideal marketplace for organizations and governments to generate funds. Financial transactions in capital markets are usually carried out by brokers registered with the exchange to conduct trade activities on behalf of their customers. This implies that a person cannot invest in stocks or bonds independently since he/she must go through brokers in orders to carry out such transactions.The main value of financial transactions in capital markets throughout the United States and global economies is that they help governments, banks, and corporations to generate long-term funds. However, trading of bonds and stocks is not usually an easy process for both novices and experienced investors because of the difficulty associated with forecasting capital market trends. Governments, banks, and corporations raise money through transactions in the capital markets in order to fund their operations and get involved in their own long-term investments.Factors that Affect Interest Rates:Interest rates are described as the basic macroeconomic indicator of an economy and are usually presented as aggregate figure. The use of these rates as macroeconomic indicators is fueled by their information regarding the current banking and financial information in an economy. Since interest rates are the costs of borrowing money, they provide a clear indication of the supply and demand of money within a specified period of time.There are several factors to consider during the evaluation of the present and future movement of interest rates. One of these major factors is the current state of the economy since changes in the economic and financial system have significant impacts on interest rates. Generally, when the economy experiences growth, there is an increase in demand for funds that result in increase in interest rates because consumers not only have jobs and savings but they also borrow for large items (""Factors Influencing Interest Rates,"" n.d.). The other factors that affect interest rates include inflationary forces, the strength of the dollar because it's the main currency in global trade, international forces, changes in the U.S. economy, deferred consumption, political gains, and supply and demand.The main factor that appears to affect interest rates the most in today's economic climate is monetary policy . Monetary policy involves interventions by the national authorities in order to control the growth of the economy as well as the inflows and outflows of money. Through monetary policy, the government may choose to stimulate the growth of the economy either through enhancing or reducing interest rates. For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve regulates the printing and value of money in the economy. The regulatory body establishes the baseline or main interest rate in the country's economy. Therefore, the Fed can either infuse or take away money from the U.S. economic and financial system.Forecasting Interest Rate Changes:Forecasting the future level of interest rates is one of the most frequent but least accurate financial predictions because every prediction of increase in interest rates requires a forecast of decrease in these rates. This process can be carried out through qualitative and quantitative approaches by considering macroeconomic variables. The process of forecasting interest rate changes can be regarded as a difficult procedure because it's least accurate and requires stability in order to improve accuracy. The inaccuracy associated with this process is attributed to the fact that these rates are reflections of human behavior that is usually very complex.The globalization of financial markets and economies has enhanced the complexity and difficulty of forecasting interest rates (""Forecasting Interest Rates,"" 2013). While experts are notorious for inaccurate forecasts, governments miss forecasts of these rates despite having control of monetary and financial policy. However, forecasting interest rates is one of the most important and valuable financial processes. These forecasts are valuable because they play a crucial role in determining the current value of streams of future payments or wealth. Furthermore, the forecasts enable firms, governments, and individuals to have reduced exposure to interest rate risks.Why Federal Reserve was Created:The Federal Reserve, which is commonly known as the Fed, was created by the U.S. Congress to act as the nation's central bank. This body was established to provide America with a more secure, more stable, and more flexible financial and monetary system (""What is the Purpose of the Federal Reserve System?"" 2013). The United States central bank was created in December 1913 following the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act by President Woodrow Wilson. Since its inception, the Federal Reserve carries out various functions and responsibilities that are classified in four major categories i.e. conducting America's fiscal policy by affecting financial and credit conditions and supervising and regulating financial institutions. The other functions are providing some financial services to the government and financial institutions and maintaining the stability of the country's financial system and markets.Therefore, the major roles of the Federal Reserve are essential to the stability and growth of the U.S. economy. Generally, this body controls all the financial activities and transactions that are carried out by various stakeholders in the economy. The essence of the Fed's essential roles to America's economy is evident in the fact that it acts as the guardian of the economy by implementing policies that keep the country functioning smoothly.Centennial Monetary Commission Act:One of the recent monetary policies to be adopted in the United States monetary system is the 2013 Centennial Monetary Commission Act. This policy was established in order to create a Centennial Monetary Commission to examine the nation's current monetary policy. This policy would have significant short-term and long-term impact on America and international economies. The short-term impact of the act is to determine the effect of the Federal Reserve on America's economic performance based on financial stability, output, prices, and employment. This will in turn help determine the astonishing interventions that the Fed has made into the U.S. economies, which has in turn affected global economies. From a long-term perspective, the act will contribute to significant and effective reforms by suggesting a course for the U.S. future monetary policy based on legislative and operational approaches (""Centennial Monetary Commission,"" 2013).Strategy for the Use of Bonds by an Investor:Generally, investments in the bond markets appear simple to investors since it's basically regarded as the process of investing in the bond…. . . READ MORE"," interest rates include inflation, foreign exchange, and the action of the central banks. Inflation is another major factor that affects interest rates since it is the rise in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy. Therefore, when the inflation rate rises, there is usually an increase in the interest rates since it is a sign of healthy economic growth.Foreign exchange also affects the movement of interest rates since it is the rate of exchange between two currencies. Generally, when the exchange rate of a currency increases, its interest rates also increase. Lastly, the action of the central bank is important in affecting interest rates. The central bank is usually charged with setting the rate of interest and regulating the supply of money in an economy (""Factors Influencing Interest Rates,"" n.d.)."

The prospect of losing points, for financial problems or other issues, is therefore a major concern and deductions have hit teams hard in previous examples.

Excessive spending, club debt and a lack of rigorous financial management have been the most common causes of points deductions across world football, while scandals involving the influencing of match results have left leagues shaken.

Most recently, Everton are facing the threat of a possible points deduction due to alleged breaches of Premier League financial rules, which the club denies.

The Sporting News looks at how points penalties have hit teams hard in the Premier League and across Europe in the past.

MORE: Why Everton could be deducted 12 Premier League points

Biggest points deductions in Premier League history

The 2023/24 season has seen renewed attention on a possible Premier League points deduction with Everton potentially facing punishment at the hands of an independent financial regulator.

The Toffees could become the third Premier League side to be deducted points. According to a report in the Telegraph, the league has recommended to the regulator that Everton be docked 12 points for alleged breaches of its profitability and sustainability rules. The club has vowed to contest the charges.

Portsmouth and Middlesbrough are the only previous Premier League teams to be deducted points mid-season. Both teams were relegated in the same campaigns in which they were sanctioned.

Portsmouth, February 2010 — 9 points deducted

Portsmouth became the first Premier League club to enter into financial administration in 2010 after building up an estimated £65 million of debt at Fratton Park.

The Premier League pushed for a significant punishment of the south-coast club as they eventually slipped down into the second tier.

Middlesbrough, March 1997 — 3 points deducted

Middlesbrough's points deduction in the 1996/97 season was not related to financial problems. The club failed to fulfil a league fixture against Blackburn Rovers and the Premier League did not accept their mitigating circumstances.

The club appealed on the grounds that injuries and illness had left them with an insufficient amount of players to complete the game, but the Premier League rejected the case.

Biggest points deductions in English football

Portsmouth and Middlesbrough were the first Premier League examples of points deductions, but other clubs outside the top flight have received similar punishments.

Season Club Points Deducted 2008/09 Luton Town 30 2021/22 Derby County 21 2008/09 Rotherham United 17 2008/09 Bournemouth 17 2007/08 Leeds United 15

Biggest points deductions in European football

Some of the biggest points deductions in European football have come away from England, most notably in Italy's Serie A.

The Calciopoli scandal in 2006 saw a host teams hit with charges relating to match-fixing and alleged payments made to referees for favourable decisions.

The investigation rocked Italian football with AC Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio all eventually hit with a 30-point penalties. Juventus were also docked 30 points and relegated from the top division, although their points penalty was eventually reduced to nine.","In a nutshell, the article looks at how points deductions from the Premier League and across Europe have led to teams dropping down divisions or even being relegated, due to issues such as financial problems, debt, and match-fixing scandals.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,"After 3 years of 'hands-off' management, Microsoft is making Bethesda ...",https://www.pcgamer.com/after-3-years-of-hands-off-management-microsoft-is-making-bethesda-and-zenimax-report-directly-to-an-xbox-bigwig/,"Just a couple of weeks after finishing its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is making some changes to its Xbox studio structure. In an internal memo acquired by The Verge, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to president of game content and studios, a role that will put him in charge of ZeniMax and its subsidiary studios, including Bethesda Softworks.

""ZeniMax will continue to operate as a limited integration entity led by Jamie Leder, President and CEO, reporting to Matt,"" Spencer wrote. ""All ZeniMax development studios and ZeniMax Central Services teams will continue reporting to Jamie to maintain and optimize current content development and production cycles. Also, to deepen our partnership and accelerate mutual learning, a number of ZeniMax leaders will now report to those Microsoft leaders with whom their work most closely aligns.""

Spencer didn't mention it by name, but there's a feeling that this reorganization is at least in part aimed at helping avoid another Redfall situation. The multiplayer FPS developed by Arkane was one of the biggest bombs of 2023—less than six months after launch, only 30 people are playing it on Steam right now—and it came to light not long after it launched that Arkane was equally unenthusiastic about it. A Bloomberg report revealed that employees at Arkane Austin hoped the Microsoft acquisition would result in either a reboot of the project, or an outright cancellation. Neither happened: Instead, Microsoft allowed ZeniMax to go about its business, which resulted in a mass exodus of veteran employees from the studio and, well, Redfall.

It's clear that those days of cowboying around are over. ""Great games are fundamental to everything we do,"" Spencer wrote. ""We believe that an expanded gaming content organization—one that enables Xbox Game Studios and ZeniMax’s development studios to collaborate effectively together—will empower those world-class studios to do their best work in growing our portfolio of games players love.""

I'm not a big fan of too much direction from the top, but in this case it might be the right move. It's not as though Microsoft is immune to stumbles (just look at Halo: Infinite) but 2023 has not been a good year for Bethesda. Redfall is the obvious blot on the ledger but even Starfield didn't live up to pre-release hype: It's a perfectly fine Bethesda open-world RPG (and, to be clear, we liked it) and by all reports a big sales hit. But it was also routine, and didn't deliver the expansive sci-fi epic we were looking forward to.

The restructuring comes just over a week after the retirement of Pete Hines, formerly Bethesda's head of publishing and its most public face—basically the Bethesda version of Larry Hryb. Among various other promotions, Spencer also announced that Sarah Bond, previously Microsoft's Xbox corporate vice president, is being promoted to president of Xbox, which will include Devices, Player & Creator Experiences, Platform Engineering, Strategy, Business Planning, Data and Analytics. and Business Development.","Microsoft has restructured its Xbox studio by promoting Matt Booty to President of Game Content and Studios, placing him in charge of ZeniMax and its subsidiary studios including Bethesda Softworks. This is likely part of an effort to avoid another Redfall situation and ensure more quality control in their gaming content, following the retirement of Pete Hines. Sarah Bond was also promoted to President of Xbox, which will include devices, platform engineering, and more."

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Pinnacle Adds Two Options for Home Equity Lending in Charlotte Minority ...,http://pnfp.com/news/news-releases/pinnacle-adds-two-options-for-home-equity-lending-in-charlotte-minority-communities/,"Lines of credit available for majority-minority communities and low- to moderate-income homeowners

Pinnacle Financial Partners is deepening its reach into minority and underserved communities while doubling down its commitment to fair and equitable finance in Charlotte. The firm has added two new home lending options specifically for households in majority-minority communities, including one just for those making less than 80 percent of the area median income. These home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) come with more flexible terms and rates than traditional options and are designed to meet the needs of these communities.

They join an array of existing Pinnacle lending options available to help people achieve the dream of homeownership and begin to build wealth using their home equity.

The Pinnacle 100 mortgage is designed to help low- to moderate-income borrowers and offers the option to finance the entire purchase price. This option is available to home buyers with a credit score of at least 650 who make less than 80 percent of the area median income.

Pinnacle Down Payment Assistance provides up to $15,000 to make a down payment, pay closing costs or lower the mortgage interest rate. This is a loan made to the home buyer that doesn’t need to be repaid for 30 years or until ownership of the home is transferred or it is refinanced.



“A home is often your most valuable personal asset and can form the foundation of a family legacy,” said Kim Graham, Pinnacle’s community development officer. “Some haven’t realized or taken advantage of it because they haven’t been connected with the right tools, like HELOCs, or they lack the knowledge to make it happen. In many cases, an entire community may be underbanked, lacking easy access to the financial tools and advice some of us take for granted. That’s a gap we aim to fill. We’re here to help people realize the potential for wealth they’re sitting on and use it to improve their homes and their lives.”

A HELOC can help protect the value and livability of a home by funding important repairs and upgrades that can increase its value. It’s a particularly important tool in cities like Nashville, where longstanding single-family neighborhoods are seeing sharp increases in property values and development around legacy homeowners. With a primary focus on partnering with highly populated minority and underrepresented communities, HELOCs can be a tool for homeowners who want to take advantage of changing neighborhoods to build greater prosperity for themselves and their families.

These HELOCs are available in amounts from $5,000-100,000. Those interested in learning more or applying can visit PNFP.com/Home for details or visit their nearest Pinnacle office to start a conversation. Eligibility will be determined after application.

Geographic restrictions apply. All mortgage and loan options are subject to credit approval. Programs and details are subject to change without notice.

Pinnacle Financial Partners provides a full range of banking, investment, trust, mortgage and insurance products and services designed for businesses and their owners and individuals interested in a comprehensive relationship with their financial institution. The firm is the No. 1 and fastest growing bank in the Nashville-Murfreesboro-Franklin MSA, according to 2023 deposit data from the FDIC, and is listed by Forbes as No. 27 among America’s Best Banks, higher than any other bank headquartered in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina or Georgia.

Pinnacle is ranked as the No. 1 workplace in the Triad, Triangle and Charlotte markets, as listed by the Triad Business Journal, Triangle Business Journal and Charlotte Observer.

The firm began operations in a single location in downtown Nashville, TN, in October 2000 and has since grown to approximately $47.5 billion in assets as of September 30, 2023.

The figure is 11 per cent up from the previous year and beats the previous league record set by United in 2019, but the English soccer giants have still reported a loss of UK£42.1 million (US$51 million).

The record earnings come in spite of the fact they were in the Uefa Europa League, rather than the more lucrative Uefa Champions League, last season.

The club have also predicted revenue for the 2023/24 period will be between UK£650 million (US$788 million) and UK£680 million (US$824 million).

The announcement comes at a time when the founder of the Ineos chemicals company, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is reported to be close to securing a 25 per cent stake in the club.

United’s wage bill for the period was down UK£52.8 million (US$64 million) to UK£331.4 million (US$401.7 million), which the club attributed to “squad turnover” and their absence from last season’s Champions League.

The report confirmed no dividends had been paid to the Glazer family who own the club.

The Glazers announced last November they had commissioned work to look at ‘strategic alternatives’ to help the club grow, which included consideration of a sale.

It now appears they will remain in control, with Ratcliffe reported to be taking a 25 per cent stake and gaining control over football operations.

The PA news agency understands Qatari businessman Sheikh Jassim withdrew his interest in a full takeover earlier this month.

Part of his bid was understood to be a commitment to clear all of the club’s debt.

United reported long-term debt at UK£507.3 million (US$614.9 million). The figure was given as US$650 million in the accounts – unchanged from the previous year – but the report said the year-on-year change in the exchange rate meant the figure in sterling was a lower amount this year compared to last.","Manchester United have reported a record revenue figure of UK£648.4 million (US$786 million) for the year ending June 30th, despite a loss of UK£42.1 million (US$51 million) and not qualifying for the Uefa Champions League.

Made my first payment in March 2020. Of course COVID hit and everyone took a hit, but I still made my payment in April, May, June, July, then was late... Made another payment in September for August and September over $400. Payments made were well over $1500 total. Then in October begin receiving calls about my lateness and demands for payment, I asked about help due to COVID, was offered a refinance of the loan and the money approved would be applied to the late payment. I declined this offer as I was not interested in increasing my balance and still having to pay monthly notes that would be higher... Then came repeat calls about my late payments. This went on into the latter part of 2021.

Received an email from an attorney regarding a garnishment order that had been approved in the amount of $4800+, I was never served with a garnishment hearing, so of course I didn't show up in court (I would have if I had been notified). Regardless of this, where I worked was served with a garnishment order, a response was given as to how much would be withheld from my check each week and sent in at the end of the 4 week period on which date. That payment was not sent in. Received another email from the attorney that the payment was made and that the company was in breach of the order. This was on December 4, 2021.

December 8th, the entire garnishment amount they sued for was paid in full plus the Lexis Nexis fee to make the payment was made over $4800. January 2022, these people reported to the credit bureau that my balance was $3803. I disputed the reporting of this information and provided a payment receipt that the entire balance owed to them had been paid off through the court's garnishment order in December 2021. They responded to the dispute that the information was reported correctly and Equifax and Experian did not remove it. I disputed this 2 more times and still they responded that it was accurate.

October 31, 2022, I call Republic Finance dept., they forwarded my inquiry to a litigation mgr. and they never called me or removed this inaccurate information. This went on the entire remaining year of 2022. November, I then called the local business, and the guy on the phone first told me to call that department back, I rejected this, he pulled up my account and preceded to tell me that I had a $143 balance and would I be paying that on the call. I told him I don't owe them anything and asked did he hear anything I just told him that the entire balance was paid off in December 2021. That call ended with me hanging up on him and telling him I am getting an attorney to sue them.

December 2023, these people report to the credit bureaus that I have a balance of $148 and charged off. In February 2023, I dispute this again and the status is updated to $0 balance, Paid charge off. I then file a complaint with CFPB regarding Fair Credit Reporting against Republic Finance, Equifax, and Experian and advise in said complaint that since my complaints and dispute are being totally disregarded and it is affecting me emotionally and financially, I am ready to sue republic, Equifax, and Experian for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting act and anything else their actions fall under.

I received an update from CFPB on March 13th, that Equifax and Experian is preparing a response and what their actions will be, but Republic Finance is yet to respond to the complaint sent to them by CFPB with file attachments of all the records I provided (payment history, garnishment payment receipt, dates of payments and other interactions with them, dispute dates and outcomes, screenshots of the credit report and their reports to the bureaus) whereas a bunch of months, they didn't report anything, not even the payment made in full on December 8, 2021. This was the short story...but, long story short, stay away from this company if you want to keep your sanity...","arA person applied and was approved for a $3800 loan in February 2020 and made regular payments until October 2020. They received calls demanding payment and offered a refinance, which they declined. In December 2021, their wages were garnished and the full amount paid off. Despite this, the company continued to report inaccurate information to the credit bureaus until February 2023. The person disputed the reports and ultimately filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, resulting in the inaccurate information being removed from their credit report."
2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,ShareAction | NGOs launch 2024 EU elections manifesto calling for…,https://shareaction.org/news/ngos-launch-2024-eu-elections-manifesto-calling-for-bold-action-on-sustainable-finance,"For more information or to request interviews, please contact the ShareAction press office at press@shareaction.org or +44 20 7183 4184

(Thursday 26th October) Today, a group of over 20 NGOs coordinated by ShareAction through the European Responsible Investment Network (ERIN), has published a manifesto for the EU elections calling on policymakers to make sustainable finance a top priority of the 2024-2029 EU agenda.

The NGOs, which work on finance, human rights and the environment, represent supporters across multiple member states, warn that a failure to legislate sufficiently ambitious policy risks creating dangerous economic instability.

The new Commission appointed for 2024 until 2029 will have the last opportunity to take action and bring forward legislation to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon economy and meet crucial 2030 targets set out in the Paris Climate Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.

Maria van der Heide, Head of EU Policy at ShareAction, said: “Banks, insurance companies, and investors continue to finance activities that deepen the climate crisis, violate human rights, and harm nature.

“Although European Union institutions and governments have introduced some sustainable finance regulation in recent years, it falls short of what is needed to support businesses to transition to a sustainable economy and protect people and planet. We need to see bold action from EU policymakers to ensure that the financial sector powers solutions, not problems.”

“People across Europe expect policymakers to ensure a safe future for them and their families. The incoming European Commission should put ambitious sustainable finance measures at the heart of its agenda, to accelerate the transition to a resilient zero-carbon economy that protects the whole of society.”

The NGOs’ key sustainable finance policy recommendations for the next European Commission include:

Expand the current taxonomy framework to accelerate investments in Europe’s inclusive transition to a zero-carbon economy: create new definitions which define business activities that are harmful, those that contribute to the transition, and those that are socially sustainable.

Account for the risks of harmful investments: bring forward legislation to increase the amount of capital banks and insurers must hold relative to their fossil fuel investments to price in climate related risks. This prevents taxpayers or governments from having to pay the bill for lost investments in fossil fuel activities that become redundant as the economy transitions.

End green and social washing: develop minimum mandatory criteria for what constitutes a sustainable investment product to tackle greenwashing and misleading claims.

The NGOs say that introducing these measures, and others set out in ‘Financing the Future We Want: Our agenda for a sustainable and inclusive EU financial sector’, will push the financial sector to reorient its investments in the right direction and tackle climate change instead of fuelling it. To be effective, they will need to be accompanied by strong enforcement systems to ensure compliance across the EU. Comprehensive policies to regulate the economy and deploy public finance will also be needed drive systemic economic and social change.

Over three quarters of Europeans are seriously concerned by climate change, and a majority think that the transition to a green economy should be sped up, according to polling from Eurobarometer from July.

World’s first regulatory framework based in Abu Dhabi for voluntary carbon markets elevates confidence

First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Helix Climate conduct first trade on the exchange

South Pole executes first over-the-counter transaction on Carbon Market Board

ACX (AirCarbon Exchange) proudly announces its exchange and clearing house in Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), ACX Abu Dhabi, is live. Key trades have already been executed and settled on the platform, signifying the commencement of what is anticipated to be a burgeoning market for voluntary carbon markets (VCM).

ACX established its regional base in ADGM in August 2021 with the support of Hub71, Abu Dhabi's global tech ecosystem. Hub71 is powered by Mubadala Investment Company PJSC (Mubadala), an Abu Dhabi sovereign investor. Mubadala invested in ACX in September 2022 as a strategic step in line with its economic diversification mandate and commitment to responsible investing.

In September 2022, ADGM, the international financial centre of the UAE’s capital that is established as a financial free zone, became the first jurisdiction to regulate voluntary carbon credits as financial instruments through the introduction of an Environmental Instrument classification, a regulatory framework to license exchanges and clearing houses for both spot and derivatives markets for these products.

In November 2022, ACX Abu Dhabi became the first entity to be licensed under this framework, being the world’s first regulated Recognised Investment Exchange and Recognised Clearing House offering Environmental Instruments in the form of carbon credits.

These regulatory licenses bolstered trust, security, and investor protection for the trading of carbon credits by mandating fair and orderly trading and real-time market surveillance, resulting in heightened market integrity, transparency and efficient price discovery. ACX strictly adheres to client asset segregation, regulatory capital and audit requirements.

With investment secured and regulatory licenses approved, ACX laid the groundwork to allow VCM participants, for the first time, to trade carbon credits and other environmental instruments under a capital markets regulatory framework.

The inaugural carbon credits trade on the fully regulated exchange was executed between First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and specialist carbon trading company Helix Climate.

Sameh Al Qubaisi, Group Head of Global Markets at First Abu Dhabi Bank, said, “We are delighted to execute the first trade on ACX Abu Dhabi. As the UAE’s largest bank, we are keen to support the expansion and potential of carbon markets to provide price signals that can help companies reduce or remove their greenhouse gas emissions in the most efficient way.”

This follows a report launched by FAB in January 2023 that explored the possibilities to seize opportunities in carbon trading as a way to fight climate change while providing flexibility for businesses in how they reduce their environmental impact.

Simon Harman, founding partner of Helix Climate, said, “Helix Climate are proud to have transacted the first trade on ACX Abu Dhabi, the first fully regulated carbon exchange. We share ACX’s vision to grow liquidity, transparency and confidence in the voluntary carbon markets and look forward to transacting more volume on the exchange.”

Arvind Ramamurthy, Chief of Market Development at ADGM, said, “Last year, ADGM welcomed the introduction of ACX, the first regulated carbon credit trading exchange and clearing house in the world and today we are more than thrilled to witness its live launch. As we find ourselves in a critical time with the development of global carbon markets, this step marks a momentous milestone in the journey towards a thriving market for voluntary carbon markets. We look forward to seeing ACX take on a pivotal role in not just environmental instruments but also in other markets and financial instruments, including virtual asset markets.”

“This marks another important step in bringing carbon credits closer to the world of regulated commodities,” said ACX’s co-founder and co-CEO William Pazos. “ACX is proud to be the world’s first fully regulated spot carbon environmental exchange and clearing house. We are equally honoured to be recognised for our ability to innovate and trigger positive change in this critically important sector.”

Further enhancing its portfolio, ACX Abu Dhabi is also pleased to announce the first trade on its Carbon Market Board (CMB) — an electronic trading facility that allows participants to execute and settle over-the-counter transactions. The trade was concluded with South Pole, the world's leading climate project developer and solutions provider.

“By providing a regulated environment for carbon credit trades, ACX is helping to build higher-integrity carbon markets: both buyers and sellers have more certainty thanks to the regulatory wrapper around the traded carbon credits and a marketplace that is scrutinised by an independent financial services authority. Trust will result in scale of climate action and impact, which is essential today,” said Abderrahman Kasmi, Executive Director for Procurement & Trading at South Pole.

Last month, ACX Group was awarded the best carbon exchange of 2023 by Environmental Finance. This is the third consecutive year that ACX wins this prestigious award, a valuable recognition of its ability to innovate and trigger positive change in this vital field.

Fasanara Capital, one of Europe’s largest credit funds in fintech, is acting as senior lender.

New asset token offering gives clients direct access to a unique new investment opportunity: exposure to a diversified portfolio of private SME loans to European SaaS and technology businesses

Token has a maturity of 18 months and a fixed annual interest rate of 14 percent, with token and investor rights fully recognised and compliant under the Swiss DLT legal framework

Tokenised private debt markets forecast to be worth USD 3.5 trillion* by 2030

The Float Token is a private debt asset token launched by Float** in partnership with Sygnum Bank on the Polygon blockchain. Exclusively available to Sygnum clients, it provides a unique opportunity to invest into a private debt portfolio alongside Fasanara Capital, a leading institutional fintech credit fund manager. The token has a maturity of 18 months with a fixed annual interest rate of 14 percent and quarterly interest payments. The token provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of SME loans to European SaaS and technology businesses.

Float token investors additionally benefit from its on-chain proof of ownership and ease of transferability, lower ticket sizes and liquidity in Sygnum’s secondary market, SygnEx. The token and investor rights are fully recognised and compliant under the Swiss DLT legal framework.

Fatmire Bekiri, Sygnum’s Head of Tokenisation, says, “The Float Token marks the first time a high-yielding private market instrument is being made widely available to investors through tokenisation. This project emphasises Sygnum’s strategic focus on making private market assets more easily accessible and investable. It is only the first issuance with more to follow.”

Fasanara Capital, one of Europe’s largest tech-enabled credit fund managers, is acting as senior lender. It manages more than USD 4 billion AuM in fintech strategies, including one of the oldest and largest global digital asset market-making funds. Francesco Filia, CEO and Co-Founder of Fasanara Capital, says, “Tokenised debt markets are on the cusp of going mainstream and we expect this asset class to reach USD 3.5 trillion by 2030. This partnership is a breakthrough for tokenisation and we are dedicated to bringing even more debt on-chain. We are proud to support bringing Float’s high-performing debt portfolio into Sygnum’s market-leading environment.”

Cedric Notz, CEO and Co-Founder of Float, says, “Revenue-Based Lending (RBL) to European SaaS businesses has one of the best performing risk-return profiles, which has also proven very resilient over time in difficult markets. The issuance of the Float Token – the first private debt asset token – required the close collaboration of experts in lending, debt financing and tokenisation to make it a reality. It is this kind of interdisciplinary, innovative partnership that will transform the face of traditional finance in the future.”

In 2020, Sygnum was the first bank to offer a regulated, end-to-end tokenisation solution comprised of Desygnate, a primary market issuance platform, and SygnEx, a secondary market trading facility. Through Sygnum, investors were able to get trusted exposure to asset classes previously seen as hard to access, like private debt markets, in a direct, fully compliant and fractional manner.

Consumer finances in South Africa are still in a dire state – despite this, some are still splurging on “feel-good” purchases.

According to the latest Consumer Financial Vulnerability Index (CFVI) from Momentum and Unisa, cyclical factors have kept consumer finances fragile in Q3 2023, but structural issues have become the main issues to consumer finances.

Political instability and corruption, unemployment, poverty and inequality and load shedding were named as the main structural impediments to improving consumer finances.

That said, there was a slight increase of the CFVI from 49.3 points in Q2 2023 to 50.9 points in Q3 2023 due to a better cyclical economic environment, driven by a declining CPI, steady interest rates and income-earning developments.

Although consumers are less financially vulnerable, they are still in despair.

The improvement was seen in all four of the major subcomponents, with income (49.9 to 52.0), expenditure (52.3 to 52.9), savings (47.3 to 49.3) and debt servicing (47.7 to 49.4).

“The improvement in the CFVI and its four sub-indices was driven by an increase in consumers’ access to an income via both employment and transfers from family and friends. This had a positive domino effect on the other three subcomponents,” the report said.

“Although consumers still limited their purchases, the better income combined with lower CPI contributed to an improvement in the expenditure index as they were better able to afford their expenses.”

“Likewise, combined with stable interest rates, the higher income improved consumers’ ability to service their debt, though they were still vulnerable in this department.”

The greater access to income and the ability to afford expenses and debt service costs allowed for more emergency savings.

That said, consumers could not add more to their retirement savings as the savings index remained below 50 points.

Source: Momentum and Unisa

Overall, consumers were more cautious and less impulsive in Q3 2023 compared to Q2 2023 and Q3 2022.

Despite being less financially vulnerable in Q3 2023, the majority were still dissatisfied about their financial situation.

Regardless, there was an increase in “feel good” purchases from 44.6% in Q3 2022 to 62.9% in Q3 2023 as consumers had more income allowing for such.

Source: Momentum and Unisa

In addition, although the cyclical factors, such as high interest rates and inflation, continue to be major risks to consumer finances, two structural risks – load shedding and political instability and corruption – grew in importance over the period.

Source: Momentum and Unisa

Looking ahead

When looking at Q4 2023, structural risks are expected to be the biggest issues, as the effect of cyclical factors is expected to subside.

“Persistent unemployment, poverty, and inequality and continuous load shedding are expected to be the highest risks to consumer finances in Q4 2023,” Momentum and Unisa said.

“Although another structural risk, political instability and corruption, moved down to the fourth highest risk, this should be viewed in context. It is a relative issue – its risk measurement was at the exact same level as in Q2 2023, but other factors are expected to become even higher risks in Q4 2023.”

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,"Greenwich finance board OKs extra $42M for Central Middle School, 2 ...",https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/greenwich-central-middle-school-18446097.php,"GREENWICH — The Board of Estimate and Taxation approved $42.017 million in new construction funding for Central Middle School in a bipartisan vote that has become uncommon on contentious issues.

Two Republicans joined Democrats to approve the funding. These Republicans, Bill Drake and Dan Ozizmir, are not seeking reelection.

The new funding, combined with the $67.5 million approved earlier this year, and another $2.5 million for planning approved last year, brings the total CMS construction funding to $112 million. This is in line with the estimate provided by the professional team working on the project.

The meeting drew a full house to the Town Hall meeting room Tuesday night and it lasted three hours.

Now that the funding is approved, project team leaders believe they are on track to start construction of a new CMS by October 2024 and finish the project by November 2026.

Tony Turner, chair of the CMS building committee, thanked the board for their vote.



“There's going to be 38,000 kids to walk through the new Central Middle School doors over the next 75 years. They thank you as well,” he said. “This investment that this board has made in the town ... is absolutely phenomenal.”

CMS funding has been a major point of discussion and debate in town this year.

Some Republicans in town are opposed to building CMS at the planned size, so much so that small cards were distributed to some Republicans with photos of Drake and Ozizmir before the meeting started.

Laura Erickson/Contributed

The cards said, in part, “Ozizmir and Drake apparently have no problem betraying their fellow Republicans on the BET, all of their constituents and worst of all, the students of Central Middle.”

Laura Erickson, a Democrat on the BET, saw these cards being handed out before the meeting. Democrats and Republicans sit at the same long desk during these meetings.

Erickson is not seeking another term on the BET because she is running for the office of first selectman, challenging Republican incumbent Fred Camillo.

Drake dialed in to the meeting by phone, so he was not physically present to receive one of these cards with his likeness.

Beth MacGillivray, chair of the Greenwich Republican Town Committee, said the RTC had “absolutely nothing to do with those cards” and that she did not receive one at the meeting.

Republican Nisha Arora said she did not receive a card, but said “now that funding for CMS has passed, we must come together as a community.”

Ozizmir confirmed that he received a card, but declined to comment on it. He said the vote last night is delivering on a promise to build CMS that he and his fellow Republicans made to voters back in 2021.

Camillo said he received a card and ripped it up.

Rebuilding CMS was prioritized after “structural concerns” were found at the school last year, meaning the project has not followed the standard town processes and did not have a feasibility study. The school is safe now and it is being continually monitored for structural soundness, Superintendent of Greenwich Public School Toni Jones said on Tuesday.

Eight BET members approved the funding request on Tuesday. One voted against it and three abstained.

All six Democrats on the board — Erickson, Miriam Kreuzer, Leslie Moriarty, Jeff Ramer, Stephen Selbst and David Weisbrod — voted for the funding, plus Drake and Ozizmir.

None of the Republicans running for the board in the upcoming election voted to fund CMS on Tuesday. Arora, Harry Fisher and Leslie Tarkington abstained and Karen Fassuliotis voted against it.

“(If you think) I'm not going to look out for the taxpayers of Greenwich and expect my vote for this extravagance and excess, you just don't understand who I am,” Fassuliotis said before the vote. “It's worth repeating that Democrats and some Republicans tonight are voting to fund a building that, as planned, will be costing $1,000 a square foot for the taxpayers of this town. I simply can't vote for this number. This project is totally out of control.”

Fassuliotis said $1,000 per square foot is an “all in” cost for the whole project. The professional team said it will cost $627 per square foot for the building only, including cost projected escalation, according to materials they presented to the BET on Tuesday.

CMS funding still needs to be approved by the Representative Town Meeting, the town’s legislative body, which is scheduled to hold a special meeting on Monday to consider the request.

From there, the Central Middle School building committee will submit a grant application to the state in hopes of getting partial reimbursement on the project. The professional team estimates that about $7.1 million will be reimbursed.

Moriarty said her caucus has remained steadfast in its support for CMS.

""It's a relief that two (Republican) retiring members finally broke ranks, so we could do the obvious,” she said in a statement.

RTC chair MacGillivray said the community is right to celebrate the BET’s approval.

“The Greenwich community has much to celebrate as the funding of the Central Middle School project has been approved by the BET. Thank you to BET Republicans for their diligent efforts in ensuring the success of one of the most significant projects in our town,"" she wrote in a statement. ""BET Republicans have taken a proactive stance, working diligently to ensure there are no unnecessary delays and that the project proceeds smoothly.""

The election is on Nov. 7.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,South Africa on the back foot – BusinessTech,https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/727392/south-africa-on-the-back-foot/,"South Africa is facing a rough mid-term budget policy statement next week, with macroeconomic forecasts deteriorating since the release of the main budget in February.

However, auditing and consultancy group PwC says that the doom and gloom figures that have been widely publicised over the past few months may be overblown, with more recent data showing a narrower budget deficit on the cards.

But even with a smaller hole in the budget, the group said South Africa is squarely on the back foot: inflation is taking longer to decline, interest rates have increased by more than expected, and GDP growth is slower than initially projected.

“Lower growth is linked to the weak outlook for household finances, which is pressuring consumption spending as well as negative business confidence impacting on capital formation,” it said.

Inflation peaked at 7.8% y-o-y in July 2022. By the time Budget 2023 was released, headline inflation had declined to 6.9% y-o-y, with the National Treasury expecting inflation to average 5.3% during 2023.

However, the headline reading climbed back to 7.1% y-o-y by March and remained outside the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) target range (3%-6%) until May.

More recently, inflation has returned to the SARB’s target range, but it has not settled. In September, inflation ticked up to 5.4% on the back of higher fuel prices – and most economists forecast the 2023 average to be at 5.9% or 6.0%.

Several factors contributed to higher-than-expected inflation, including rand weakness: still-elevated global food price inflation, larger-than-expected fuel price increases, and the adverse effect of load-shedding on supply chains.

“This has resulted in slower disinflation — the decline in monthly y-o-y readings — compared to what many analysts were expecting earlier this year,” PwC said.

Unsurprisingly, the SARB responded to this environment with monetary policy moves, lifting interest rates by a cumulative 125 basis points in 2023 – about 50 bps more than many economists had anticipated at the start of the year.

“This, in turn, has negatively impacted the broader economy,” the group said.

While rates have been on hold since July, the uptick in inflation has some economists projecting another possible hike in November, although views are split between that and another hold.

On top of inflation and interest rates, however, South Africa’s economy is also dealing with negatives elsewhere.

Business confidence has not been enough to encourage investment, PwC said; meanwhile, the country’s trade surplus has shrunk from R161 billion in 2022 to R32 billion in 2023.

Global commodity prices have declined, tax collections have come in lower, and concerns have been mounting that the country will face a significant revenue shortfall by the end of the financial year.

Overblown

On the revenue front, however, PwC has cautioned against the deeply negative tones, saying that, while the country’s tax collections are likely to be much lower than forecast, it’s still too early in the current financial year to make an accurate call.

In addition, corporate tax collections in August were better than expected, and other revenue sources are holding up – which should narrow the gap.

According to Kyle Mandy, PwC South Africa Tax Policy Leader, the group currently expects a total tax revenue shortfall of up to R30 billion in 2023/2024.

“That is a significant improvement over an earlier prognosis — around R50 billion — following strong collections of Corporate Income Tax in August,” he said.

“The month of August is important for understanding the CIT landscape as it includes the first provisional tax payments for companies with February year-ends.

“Furthermore, collections of Personal Income Tax are holding up well, and will likely be around R10 billion above Budget 2023 estimates, on the back of stronger-than-expected job creation and wage growth.”

The more positive outlook for personal income tax is due to the higher than anticipated increases to wages in the public sector, where the government has settled on 7.5% hikes compared to the 3.5% pencilled into the budget.

“A R30 billion tax gap would result in a tax buoyancy ratio of 0.84 in 2023/2024. This would be the lowest reading since the global financial crisis,” Mandy said.

Silent cancellations are when gym-goers cancel their membership without explaining why, either indirectly or directly, essentially the gym and health club equivalent of “quiet quitting.”

According to data from Xplor Technologies, many silent cancellations are caused by failed payments. But there are several other reasons a member could get rid of their membership without providing an explanation.

Athletech News spoke with Michelle Furniss, the general manager of Xplor Gym, who has worked at the company in various commercial and management roles for the past 10 years. Furniss explained why silent cancellations occur and shared how operators can reduce their prevalence.

Athletech News: What causes silent cancellations?

Michelle Furniss: Forty percent of former members have had a membership canceled because of a payment failure – where they either canceled their bank transfer with their bank without telling the club, or there were insufficient funds in the bank account, or the bank account was closed. Another 12 percent of members canceled directly with their club but failed to tell them why they were leaving. And just like “ghosting” in the dating world, members slowly stop attending the gym, until they finally end up either cancelling or canceled, disappearing without a word.

ATN: What are the business impacts of silent cancellations?

MF: The impact of silent cancellations is huge – it can mean the difference between having a successful, profitable business or not. And the worst thing about silent cancellations is the fact that many gyms and health clubs do not know why a member has left. Every gym and health club owner invests significant time and money in attracting new members. So, getting an accurate reason for leaving from former members is essential for reducing a club’s overall attrition rates and protecting recurring revenue. With insights into the common reasons for leaving, owners can address these so that fewer members leave for the same reason in the future.

ATN: What are the common reasons U.S. gym-goers cancel their membership?

MF: The reality is that half of members will leave without ever telling their club why. Fifty-two percent of cancellations happen silently – with members not providing a reason or canceling indirectly. Other anecdotal reasons for cancellations include no longer being able to afford the cost, a change in circumstances like changing jobs or moving house, and/or dissatisfaction with the club itself (either with the facilities, instructors or equipment, or lack of availability of classes). But while silent cancellations make up half of all cancellations, there is still an opportunity for clubs to protect themselves from these – either by finding out what the issue was and resolving it or by doing more to save these members before they cancel.

ATN: When do gym-goers typically cancel?

MF: More than half of all cancellations tend to occur in the second half of the year. Our data shows that 58.6 percent of cancellations happen between July and December, and the peak month for cancellations is September, with just over 10 percent of cancellations that month alone. Given that many people sign up for membership at the start of the year, unsurprisingly the fewest cancellations happen in February (5.9 percent), followed by January (6.3 percent). On average, members cancel their membership around 26 months after joining, and those who cancel tend to have stopped visiting their gym or health clubs around five months before this. What does this mean for gyms and club owners? Review your membership data, especially length of membership and how regularly they are visiting and find out which members are at risk of leaving. You may be able to encourage those members at risk back into the gym before they cancel.

ATN: What are your top tips to reduce silent cancellations?

MF: There are many ways gyms and health clubs can protect themselves from silent cancellations. Here are the top five:"," save them before they cancel.Michelle Furniss of Xplor Technologies explains that silent cancellations, or cancellations without explanation, can happen for a variety of reasons and can have a large impact on gyms and health clubs. Furniss shares best practices such as regularly reviewing membership data and understanding why members are leaving to help prevent silent cancellations."

In conjunction with the launch, the firm is delighted to welcome Craig Luton, who will become Singapore Managing Partner. Prior to joining Mourant, Craig was a partner in Maples and Calder’s Funds and Investment Management team in Singapore.

Craig specialises in the structure, formation, launch and maintenance of Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands private equity funds, venture capital funds, and hedge funds, as well as downstream private equity transactions. Craig will work closely with our market-leading Asia-based Banking and Finance and Litigation teams, as well as our governance services professionals.

Mourant also has plans to develop its Singapore Banking and Finance and Litigation practices and, in due course, to add a governance services offering.

The move cements the firm’s growing global prominence, expanding its geographical reach, pivoting further towards alternative asset management, and capitalising on the rising significance of Singapore as a global finance centre, as well as the growing importance of the South East Asia financial services market.

Paul Christopher, Managing Partner of the Mourant Hong Kong office, will oversee the pan-Asia practice, in a new role as Managing Partner, Asia. Paul will continue to lead the Hong Kong office which has grown significantly in recent years to a team of 60, including nine partners.

This latest expansion is aligned with Mourant’s expansive multi-disciplinary growth strategy, following the launch of Mourant Consulting in 2021, the acquisition of a Mauritius and Guernsey-based accounting business in January 2022, and Luxembourg-based law firm, LexField, and governance services business, FideField, recently joining the Mourant global group.

The expansion will take the firm’s overall headcount to over 700, operating from nine offices and spanning all major time zones.

Mourant Global Managing Partner, Jonathan Rigby, commented:

“I am delighted to confirm our expansion into Singapore, cementing our presence in Asia. Alongside our move into Luxembourg earlier this year, this is another important milestone for Mourant as we continue to push ahead with our ambitious growth plans.”

Paul Christopher added:

“I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Craig Luton who will be joining us as Managing Partner of our Singapore office. Craig has a wealth of experience in investment funds and private equity and this, combined with the firm’s existing strong relationships in the region, will increase Mourant’s geographical reach.”

The Anti-Defamation League and the Council on American-Islamic Relations saw increases in reported instances, many involving violence or threats against protesters at rallies in support of Israel or in support of Palestinians over the last two weeks as war broke out between Israel and Hamas. Other attacks and harassment reported by the groups were directed at random Muslim or Jewish people in public.

A spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Wednesday that the organization’s chapters and national office had received 774 reports of bias-related acts between Oct. 7 and Oct. 24. The national headquarters had 110 direct reports during that period, compared to 63 for all of August. The council’s leaders believe it’s the largest wave of complaints since December 2015, when then-presidential candidate Donald Trump declared his intent to ban Muslim immigration to the U.S. in the wake of the San Bernadino mass shooting that left 14 people dead.

The reported acts since Oct. 7 include an Illinois landlord fatally stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy and wounding the boy’s mother, police say, as well as the arrest of a Michigan man after police say he asked people in a social media post to join him in hunting Palestinians.

“Public officials should do everything in their power to keep the wave of hate sweeping the nation right now from spiraling out of control,” said Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

Saylor noted that former President George W. Bush’s visit to a mosque after the 9/11 attacks had a calming effect on the backlash felt in Muslim communities. He called on President Joe Biden to visit with Americans who lost family members in Gaza.

The Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism reported in a statement Wednesday that the organization recorded at least 312 reports of antisemitic acts between Oct. 7 and Oct. 23 — compared to 64 recorded during the same time period in 2022. Those reports included graffiti, slurs or anonymous postings, as well as physical violence such as a woman being punched in the face in New York by an attacker who the league says said, “You are Jewish.”

The 312 reports included 109 anti-Israel sentiments spoken or proclaimed at rallies the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism found to be “explicit or strong implicit support for Hamas and/or violence against Jews in Israel,” according to the statement.

Protesters at several of the rallies used the slogan, “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which the Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish groups have criticized as a call to dismantle the state of Israel. Many Palestinian activists say they are not calling for the destruction of Israel, but for freedom of movement and equal rights and protections for Palestinians throughout the land.

The Anti-Defamation League called for strong responses to antisemitic posts, rhetoric and acts. The organization said violent messages that mention Jews on platforms like Telegram Messenger have increased even more than reports of in-person instances.

“It is incumbent on all leaders, from political leaders to CEOs to university presidents, to forcefully and unequivocally condemn antisemitism and terrorism,” Jonathan Greenblatt, Anti-Defamation League CEO, wrote in the statement.

Jewish civil rights organizations in the United Kingdom, France and other countries across Europe, Latin America, North Africa and elsewhere have also tracked increases in antisemitic acts in the past few weeks compared to 2022. League officials said London police had received 218 reports of antisemitic crimes between Oct. 1 and Oct. 18, which was 13 times greater than the numbers reported in 2022.

North Yorkshire, U.K.-based family-owned seafood business Whitby Seafoods recently pulled out of its purchase of Kilhorne Bay Seafoods due to the resource-heavy process required to finalize the deal.

Whitby Seafoods, the country’s largest scampi producer, announced plans to acquire Northern Ireland-based seafood supplier Kilhorne Bay in August 2023. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) subsequently confirmed it was investigating the planned merger and that a phase 1 decision on the acquisition process would come by 4 October.

With the CMA announcing on that date that it intended to refer the proposed deal for an in-depth phase 2 investigation as part of its merger review process, Whitby Seafoods informed the authority that it wouldn’t be proceeding with its acquisition plan.

“As a Yorkshire-based, family-owned business with a commitment to providing high-quality, excellent value breaded scampi to our customers, the proposed merger was appealing because our values are highly aligned with Kilhorne – a small family-owned company based in Northern Ireland,” Whitby Seafoods stated. “Half of Kilhorne’s scampi sales were in Europe, and this gave Whitby a unique opportunity to build a new market for our business.

Our chart illustrates how the deficit increased significantly from the $1.0trn reported for FY2019 ($3.5trn receipts less $4.5trn outlays) to $3.1trn in FY2020 ($3.4trn-6.5trn) and $2.8trn in FY2021 ($4.0trn-$6.8trn) at the height of the pandemic, before falling to $1.4trn in FY2022 ($4.9trn-$6.3trn) as the US economy recovered. The deficit by $0.3trn increased to $1.7trn in FY2023 ($4.4trn-$6.1trn) and is budgeted to increase by a further $0.2trn to $1.9trn in FY2024 ($5.0trn forecast receipts-$6.9trn forecast outlays).

Not shown in the chart is the excess of financial liabilities over financial assets, which increased by $1.7trn from $22.3trn on 30 September 2022 to $24.0trn on 30 September 2023. This differs from ‘debt held by the public’ (the headline measure of federal debt), which increased by $2.0trn from $24.3trn to $26.3trn, more than the federal deficit because of movements in other financial assets and liabilities.

Receipts in FY2023 of $4,439bn comprised $2,176bn in individual income taxes, £1,614bn in social security and retirement contributions, $420bn in corporation income taxes, $80bn in customs duties, $76bn in excise taxes, £34bn in estate and gift taxes and $39bn in other receipts. Outlays for same period of $6,134bn comprised $1,737bn on health and Medicare, $1,354bn on social security, $821bn on defence, $774bn in welfare benefits, $659bn in interest, $302bn for veteran services and benefits, $127bn on transportation, $100bn on commerce, and $260bn on other outlays.

The latter includes the administration of justice, agriculture, community and regional development, education, training, employment and social services, energy, general government, general science, space and technology, international affairs, natural resources and environment, and undistributed offsetting receipts.

These amounts are different from the accruals-based US GAAP federal government financial statements for FY2023 that are expected to be published next April, which will show a much larger accounting loss than the federal deficit reported here. For example, the FY2022 net operating cost (ie accounting loss) of $4.2trn was $2.8trn higher than the federal deficit of $1.4trn for last year, of which the largest difference of $2.6trn related to accruals for federal employee and veteran benefits.

These amounts appear astronomical, especially to those of us living in smaller (and unfortunately) less prosperous countries than the 335m people who live in the US, with its estimated GDP of $26.3trn in FY2023 – equivalent to around $6,600 per person per month.

Federal receipts and outlays in FY2023 represented 17% and 23% of GDP respectively or on a per capita basis were approximately $1,105 and $1,525 per person per month. The federal deficit was therefore equivalent to 6% of GDP or $420 per person per month.

The excess of financial liabilities over financial assets and debt held by the public were 91% and 100% of GDP respectively, equivalent to an amount owed of around $71,500 or $78,500 per person, depending on which measure is used.","The US government reported a federal deficit of $1.7 trillion for its recently completed financial year ended 30 September 2023, compared to $1.0 trillion in FY2019. The deficit increased significantly due to the pandemic, while debt held by the public increased by $2.0 trillion to $26.3 trillion. Receipts and outlays represented 17% and 23% of GDP respectively, with the deficit equivalent to 6% of GDP."

The Paris based bank released its Q3 results today and in the accompanying presentation, it said technology is ""at the heart"" of its strategy titled GTS ('Growth technology sustainability' 🌱) for 2025. Two key areas within that strategy are cloud infrastructure and AI experimentation.

Today, just 43% of BNP's applications are in the cloud. The goal within the next two years is to upgrade that to 60%, with upwards of 15,000 employees cloud certified. In AI, the bank had a target of doubling its number of AI implementations and looks well on its way to achieving that. BNP has over 700 AI use cases right now, and is working on around 300 more, including 26 leveraging generative AI. It also claims to be the number one European bank (sixth globally) for hiring AI talent.

Tech hiring has been stagnant in banking on average, but BNP seems to be looking more pert. Of its 4,523 current openings, 779 are in technology. 195 of those mention cloud, 335 AI. Pay for BNP's tech people might have risen too; on Levels.fyi, average software engineering compensation in the US and Europe has gone up from $81.6k in 2022 to $88.2k in 2023.

Engineers seem to enjoy working at BNP more than most. On Glassdoor, the bank has an average rating of 3.8 stars, but technologists rate it 4.1. For remote first technologists, it even bucks the current industry standard of 3+ days in office by asking its people to come in only 50% of the time. However, it's becoming increasingly strict in monitoring how often its staff are at their office desks.

Premier League clubs including Liverpool are awaiting outcomes on two huge - and potentially groundbreaking - decisions in relation to the ongoing financial investigations into Everton and Manchester City.

There are two cases of alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules by Premier League club. The latest case concerns Everton, who were referred to an independent commission in March for alleged breaches during the 2021/22 season.

The Telegraph claimed on Wednesday that “the Premier League has recommended Everton's punishment to be extremely severe, and up to a maximum of 12 points.” If found guilty, the club are facing a number of potential other sanctions, including a fine and/or a potential transfer embargo but Everton have stressed they have complied with the rules and insist they will “robustly defend” their position

READ MORE: What will happen to Everton next after Premier League points deduction 'threat'

The case is currently being heard by an independent commission and the ECHO understands that the independent commission – not the Premier League – holds full sway when it comes to the final decision-making process. Everton reported losses of around £371.8million over the past three years, but the rules say clubs can only lose a maximum of £105million or they face charges.

This could be a big moment in how the league deals with financial conduct. The other case involves Manchester City, which is quite complicated.

The Premier League champions were sent to an independent panel in February for supposedly breaking league rules 115 times between 2009 and 2018. The league's five-year investigation brought up several different claims against the club.

Some of these allegations were about incorrect financial information, while others detailed financial payments to a former manager and other claims of not following the rules. City deny these claims in a statement, and their manager Pep Guardiola said he wants a decision ""as soon as possible"".

This isn't the first time City have had to deal with similar financial allegations. UEFA previously banned the club from European competitions and fined them. However, this was eventually overturned at the Court of Arbitration for Sport because most allegations were either not proven or they were time-barred - meaning they happened too long ago according to UEFA rules that say old allegations can't be pursued.

Many fans are questioning why it's taking so long to make a decision on the current case with City, compared to that of Everton. The truth is, these cases are very different, with Everton facing one charge over a shorter period, which would be quicker to rule on.

In contrast, City's case involves over 100 separate allegations spanning nine years and a five-year investigation. This makes the process of reviewing each case, making a ruling, and compiling a final decision a lengthy and careful task. It could be years before the panel reaches a decision.

But should Everton end up facing a points deduction, Liverpool and other Premier League rivals may expect the same to happen should Man City also face punishment.

The FRC commissioned the Government Actuary’s Department to carry out the research, which was based on interviews with 37 individuals working in the sector and a survey completed by over 100 respondents.

The research found General Insurance Pricing to be the actuarial field currently making greatest use of AI and ML. This includes for determining claims risks, forecasting the price-sensitivity of policyholder groups, and informing customer-facing processes.

In line with expectations that AI and ML have considerable potential to transform the way actuarial work is carried out, the research also found widespread plans among actuaries to increase its use in future, particularly as a result of rapid developments in large language models such as ChatGPT.

The research highlights explainability of AI and ML models as a leading concern among practitioners and their stakeholders, with work practices evolving to address this. The most frequently cited potential risk was AI and ML models being treated as ‘black boxes’ with limited understanding of their internal workings.

Research participants also cited the potential for bias and/or discrimination as important risks that AI and ML might exacerbate in actuarial work. These could arise directly from the techniques used or indirectly from the expanded data usage that AI and ML make possible.

Other key sources of risk for the quality of actuarial work included the quality of data, data privacy, lack of human oversight, and over-reliance on results without understanding their limitations.

Mark Babington, FRC Executive Director of Regulatory Standards, said:"," “We will be monitoring the development of AI and ML in the sector, as well as its impact on the quality of actuarial work.”The Financial Reporting Council has published new research examining the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in UK actuarial work, finding General Insurance Pricing as the field making the greatest use of the technology.

2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Lincoln Airport: Red Way must pay refunds before final check,https://journalstar.com/news/local/business/lincoln-airport-red-way-refunds-invoice-check/article_7f329ffe-743c-11ee-8629-172305b7dd05.html,"The Lincoln Airport Authority passed a resolution on Thursday in an attempt to get refunds for about 670 people still holding tickets for canceled Red Way flights.

""We are taking steps to assist the remaining Red Way customers who have not received refunds,” said John Olsson, the airport authority board chair.

The resolution would allow payment to the failed startup airline for its final invoice only after it refunds about $450,000 to ticket holders for flights that never took place.

""It identifies the concerns dealing with refunds,"" said David Haring, executive director of Lincoln Airport. ""And it identifies some concerns related to collection of other fees that were specifically for a designated purpose that have not been received.""

Earlier, the airport authority officially accepted an independent accountant's report — a detailed list of every flight and all income and expenditures incurred by Red Way, which began flying in early June before it pulled the plug at the end of August.

The final payment to Red Way was capped to not exceed the $3 million — $1.5 million each from the city of Lincoln and Lancaster County in American Rescue Plan Act funds — used to help launch the airline.

The independent audit cleared the way for Red Way's final invoice — $707,300 — to be presented for payment to the Lancaster County Board of Commissioners, which has the final say on whether to pay it.

However, the airport authority made it clear on Thursday it wants the $450,000 in ticket refunds to be paid first.

""It is my conclusion that these funds should be available for passenger refunds,"" said Nicki Behmer Popp, the only member of the airport authority board to vote against passing the invoice to the Lancaster County Commission. ""If they are not readily available, the board and the customers deserve to know what happened to those funds before any additional payments are made to Red Way.""

Last week, it was discovered that Red Way was sending emails to ticket holders telling them their refunds couldn't be made until the Lincoln Airport made good on the money it owed the airline.

It prompted Olsson to explain the way the ticketing process works.

According to U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, when a customer purchased tickets with Fly Next LLC (Red Way's official business name), ""Red Way, as the charter operator, has to take specific steps to protect that customer's money,"" Olsson said.

The air carrier is required to have a surety agreement, such as a bond or, more commonly, an escrow account at a bank to hold that money until the flight is completed.

""Neither the Lincoln Airport, nor any other airport, has access to these escrow funds,"" Olsson said. ""That agreement exists solely between the customer and the charter operator.""

Thursday's resolution requires Maverick BankCard Inc., the processing agent for Red Way's ticket sales, to pay the refunds first, before Red Way's final payment can be received.

""Once that has been substantiated and proven, then the airport will move the money from there,"" Haring said.

And while the resolution, drawn up by Lincoln Airport attorney Bill Kutilek, is legal, Haring warned that Maverick may not honor the terms of the resolution.

""This resolution allows us to do it, but it doesn't necessarily mean (Maverick) is going to do it,"" he said.

the meaning erupted

like a bomb in Gaza

and why the ground is shaking every few minutes

and the windows

and the half empty glass on the table

and the framed picture of a man you’ve never met

on the wall

and people say that’s your dad

my mom took me to a funeral

and everyone was crying

and my mom cried

I felt the whole world started shaking

and I cried

and I wet my pants

‘mama let’s go out of here’

pulling her head scarf

and people thought I’m so sympathetic with the one who’d died

but my mom was crying

and all this is pointless



the main question is

how can one explain to a three-year-old

sitting in a bus

heading to the south

why we should leave our house today

in the midst of all these horrible sounds

and the rubbles of buildings and of

humans

and why…

(the bus erupted)



I’m sorry I’m truly sorry

I know we’re not supposed to use too many adjectives

in a modern poem

that’s just bad taste

I know

I know that poetry should be self-referential and create a semi-autonomous environment

that poetry is not to gain its meaning from outside

signs should interrelate and then the surplus significance emerges from within

I know we shouldn’t express our feelings so explicitly



but forgive me

that I couldn’t think of any ‘objective correlative’

for the bombardment of the children’s hospital in Gaza

for people’s thirst

for the bodies left behind



just like when Neruda couldn’t find any

for ‘the blood of children ran through the streets

without fuss, like children's blood.’



forgive me that there is no literary equivalence for the catastrophe

there has never been.



today

when I was having my cereal

sitting beside my daughter

in a city in the middle of the UK

the meaning erupted

and it’s unraveling my poetry

(and how cliche this trick is! Disgusting!)



I went to the main square afterward

to see others who’ve felt the earthquake just like me

from far away

we looked at each other’s eyes

we said ‘oh it’s awful’

it’s horrendous

we shared our mutual despise of the political leaders

we talked about the horror

about water

electricity

bread

about last night’s meal that we’d had in the pub nearby

‘how is Tom by the way?’

a friend asked

tom was alright

fortunately

minding his own business

and we chanted

someone said ‘what a cute little girl’



but nobody asked that main question

that we were all thinking of



that how you can explain to a...

the basement exploded.

(another rubble among the rubbles)

no need to explain anymore.

no need to think about it.","no need to talk about it.no need to write about it.This poem reflects on the tragedy of the conflict in Gaza, and the helplessness of being unable to explain such violence to young children. It acknowledges the powerlessness of poetry in the face of such atrocity, while also recognizing how the news of the tragedy affects those who are far away. The poem ultimately serves as a call to action, to recognize the suffering and to do something to end it."
2023-10-26T00:00:00.0000000,Using AI to cut through online noise and source unbiased news,https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/using-ai-cut-through-online-noise-and-source-unbiased-news,"Seeking unbiased opinions is challenging in today’s fast-paced news cycle. Some news sources leave out important facts, inadvertently skewing public perception on current events.

Ground News, an alumni company from Velocity, University of Waterloo’s startup incubator, is combatting this with the launch of a new tool powered by artificial intelligence. The tool will help readers quickly understand a story from multiple perspectives so they can spot media bias when they read it.

For example, when searching for news related to the recent diplomatic dispute between India and Canada, Ground News's AI tool summarizes key details in bullet point form, emphasizing key points across the political spectrum.

“News shapes how people think about the world and how we make important decisions,” said Ground News Co-Founder and CEO Harleen Kaur. “We should all have access to the same information and it's hard to believe that that isn’t the case.”

Ground News doesn’t report news or fact check reporting made by media outlets. It is a subscription-based news aggregator that collects articles from around the world and across the political spectrum. Each user’s news feed shows how the same story is covered in different news outlets, the publication’s political leaning and ownership, and reporting factuality, which is based on external fact checking methodologies.

“It’s a set of tools that makes looking at different perspectives of the same news story accessible,” said Ground News Co-Founder and CTO Sukh Singh. “No matter your age, profession, walk of life or socioeconomic background, you should be able to access information that is available to everyone else and make the most informative, well-reasoned decisions that you can.”

At Velocity, Ground News was able to develop its product-market fit, raised seed funding, and grew revenue through its subscription model.

Kaur, who previously worked at NASA, and Singh, an alumni from University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Engineering, chose Velocity to be part of the Kitchener-Waterloo tech ecosystem, proximity to University of Waterloo talent, and to join the Velocity community.

“When we established Ground News I was living and working in Berlin, Germany but our choice between Europe and Canada was so clear — Velocity was such a good fit for us that I moved continents,” Kaur said. “At Velocity, you have world-class mentors and advisors who continually ask how to help. Their support is very personalized.”

About Velocity

Velocity accelerates entrepreneurs' growth from idea to early-stage start-up and beyond. These founders have access to unmatched resources, collaboration space, funding, and an expansive and experienced network made possible only by the University of Waterloo — Canada's top university for founders. In the 15 years since its inception as a University of Waterloo residence, more than 400 Velocity companies have netted more than US$26 billion in enterprise value.","Ground News, an alumni company from Velocity, University of Waterloo's startup incubator, has launched an AI tool to help readers quickly understand news stories from multiple perspectives, spot media bias, and make more informed decisions.

It is an industry that is constantly in motion and in a continuous state of change and flux. So rapid is that change that DemolitionNews evolved from updates once or twice a week to six and seven days per week. Today, DemolitionNews is the driving force behind a LiveStream that covers all the very latest industry developments on a daily basis.

But while the changes are constant and rapid, are they truly significant? Are they game-changing developments capable of shifting the direction or redrawing the landscape of the industry as a whole?

Having thought about it long and hard and having consulted with a number of other industry professionals for whom I have the utmost respect, I am not convinced that there have been any significant contributions for, well, for quite some time.

The Accredited Site Audit Scheme introduced by the National Federation of Demolition Contractors (NFDC) back in the early 2000s was launched with great fanfare and promise. But, even though it remains a prerequisite of NFDC membership, the scheme has failed to progress. The site being audited is nominated by the member company and it is timed to suit them too – hardly the exacting litmus test of competence and compliance we had all hoped it might become.

The various sets of guidance notes produced by the NFDC similarly had the potential to raise standards among the Federation membership and beyond. But like a swotty schoolboy covering his work with his arm to ensure it isn’t copied, the NFDC has now placed those valuable guidance notes behind a firewall, accessible to just a select few. (It surely undermines any claims of elite status when access to a few books is considered a key differentiator).

The demolition degree pioneered by the Institute of Demolition Engineers gave the industry its first tangible taste of academic credibility; and certainly those that emerged with the qualification did so – rightly – with considerable pride. But the degree course seems to have faltered and now requires a significant shot in the arm if it is to truly progress.

Having polled several key individuals with their fingers on the industry pulse, we have managed to come up with just two potentially game-changing developments of recent years.

The first, I believe, is the Top Down Way tower block demolition system pioneered by Italian contractor Despe. It is unquestionably an engineering marvel; but it is also a vertical (if you’ll pardon the pun) innovation with relatively limited scope – It is best suited to tower blocks of 90 metres or taller. In the right application, the Top Down Way is a game-changer; sadly, the right application does not come along anywhere near often enough.

The second true game-changer, in my opinion and the opinion of others, is the automatic quick coupler from the likes of OilQuick. Steelwrist and Lehnhoff. The arrival of those quick couplers spawned a mini revolution within the industry. Today, no demolition contractor worth its salt is without quick couplers and the broad array of attachments it facilitates.

But that’s not much, is it? For an industry that is constantly innovating and constantly evolving, that is not a great deal to show for two decades or more.

Maybe the industry is now so mature that it is wrong to expect a landscape-shifting development at this stage. We already have high reach machines so now only the height is likely to vary. We have demolition robots so we have already pinned our colours to the remote control and autonomous operation mast that those in construction are only now beginning to consider.

But for all those meetings, those working parties, those committees, the R&D spend, and all those incremental innovations, the industry needle has barely shifted.","After 30 years of charting the rise and fall of the UK demolition industry, it is clear that although there are constant changes, there have not been any significant game-changing developments in the last two decades. The only two potential game-changers are the Top Down Way tower block demolition system and the automatic quick coupler."

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 (Bernama) -- The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has set that due diligence visits must be conducted to determine whether a company is eligible for Bumiputera status and not solely based on documentation to ensure the authenticity of the company’s status.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Azure’s board will back the new binding bid from SQM, which increased its cash offer by 52% to A$3.52 per share, the Australian producer said Thursday. That’s a 44% premium over Azure’s closing price on Oct. 20, and follows a previously rejected non-binding offer of A$2.31 made in August.

The company’s shares jumped as much as 44% on Thursday to A$3.52, their highest price since June 2008.

The proposal comes amid a recent frenzy of interest in the Australian lithium sector among the world’s biggest mining heavyweights and battery manufacturers, as companies including Rio Tinto Plc and Tesla Inc. chase deals with firms with even early-stage or pre-production projects. That’s helped spark a stunning rally for many newly founded and previously little-known companies in Australia, where lithium mining is dominated by small and mid-sized firms.

Azure shares are more than 15 times higher than they were at the end of 2022, helped by news in June of “exceptional” drilling results at its Andover site in Western Australia, one of the most lithium-rich regions in the world. SQM’s offer is not subject to due diligence conditions.

Still, the metal’s price is looking increasingly volatile, with the crucial battery ingredient now down about 64% from a record earlier this year. SQM, the world’s second-biggest lithium producer and Chile’s largest, recently batted off price concerns and reiterated an upbeat view for electric-vehicle sales growth — but investors are eyeing a looming wave of consolidation as lower valuations create a new slew of potential takeover targets.

Story continues

Last week, one of the largest battery-metals deals to date was scuppered when top producer Albemarle Corp. walked away from a A$6.6 billion proposal to buy Liontown Resources Ltd. — after Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart muscled her way into a takeover battle for the Perth-based miner.

US-based Livent Corp. has agreed to combine with Allkem Ltd. to create a $10.6 billion producer. Chile’s Codelco will buy Lithium Power International Ltd. in its first lithium takeover. Meanwhile, Chinese producer Tianqi Lithium Corp. made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Essential Metals Ltd.

SQM is expanding in Australia as it faces the possibility of its Chilean contract expiring in 2030. The company is in talks with state-owned Codelco for a new contract under the government’s public-private-participation model in which it would give up a majority stake in future operations.

The Chilean miner in January bought 20% of Azure, and is the company’s largest shareholder. SQM also made a conditional off-market takeover offer of A$3.50 a share if the scheme of arrangement is not successful.

JPMorgan stock sinks on news Dimon will sell shares

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was one of the worst Dow Jones stocks Friday after a securities filing revealed Jamie Dimon, CEO of the financial giant, plans to sell 1 million JPM shares in 2024. Dimon currently owns 8.6 million shares of JPM, and it will mark his first stock sale since he took over the head role in 2006.

""Mr. Dimon continues to believe the company’s prospects are very strong and his stake in the company will remain very significant,"" JPMorgan Chase said in the 8-K filing . Nevertheless, the blue chip stock tumbled 3.6% today.

However, the worst Dow stock today was Chevron (CVX), which plunged 6.7% after the oil major reported third-quarter earnings of $3.05 per share – well below the $3.70 per share analysts were expecting. Still, revenue of $51.9 billion came in above estimate. Earlier this week, Chevron said it will buy fellow energy firm Hess (HES) for $53 billion in stock.

Amazon earnings keep Nasdaq above water

As for the main indexes, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fared the worst, shedding 1.1% to 32,417. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 4,117, ending in correction territory following a 10% decline from its July 31 closing high of 4,588.96.

The Nasdaq, which entered a correction on Wednesday, eked out a 0.4% gain to 12,643, thanks to impressive Amazon earnings. The e-commerce giant reported much higher than expected third-quarter earnings of 94 cents per share on revenue of $143.1 billion. Operating income of $11.2 billion came in well above the company's forecast, though revenue growth (+12% year-over-year) in the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud segment was softer than anticipated. AMZN stock surged 6.8% today.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Musk predicts Twitter/X's financial app will launch within a year - Fortune,https://fortune.com/2023/10/27/twitter-x-control-your-entire-financial-life-2024/,"As Elon Musk celebrates one year of owning Twitter/X, he’s outlining plans for its future to staffers, including aspirations to be the epicenter of people’s financial world.

In a call with workers Thursday, which The Verge obtained a recording of, Musk outlined his vision for the site’s financial integration, saying he expected the feature to launch by the end of 2024.

“When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial life,” Musk reportedly said. “If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank account.”

It’s familiar territory, in a sense, for Musk, who cofounded PayPal and has been disappointed with Ebay’s handling of the company since its sale. He never gave up the dream of building a global payments platform and has been vocal about his aspirations for Twitter/X. Musk’s run-ins with the “PayPal Mafia” were reported by Fortune all the way back in 2007.

“I think there’s potential to create a more efficient financial system,” Musk said in a CNBC interview earlier this year, adding it would be “poetic to fulfill ultimately the vision that I had for X over 23 years ago, and actually see that come to fruition.”

The company has applied for federal and state regulatory licenses and has been granted them from Michigan, Missouri, and New Hampshire.

Those licenses, which allow companies to receive and transfer funds, are an important first step for Twitter/X’s financial ambitions. To operate across the United States, and between states, however, Twitter will need to receive an individual license from each state, although there is a system that allows companies to apply across multiple states at once.

Twitter will reportedly focus on fiat payment tools initially, although crypto could become a later priority. Musk has been a longtime cheerleader of memecoins, including Dogecoin. Some detractors, however, have argued that he has intentionally driven up that coin’s price. And in June 2022, a lawsuit was filed alleging he was engaged in a “crypto pyramid scheme.”

There are plenty of hurdles, though. Chief among those is whether Twitter has sufficient staff to build out the platform, especially in his accelerated time frame. (It’s hardly the first time Musk has pushed his workers to the breaking point for an arbitrary date.)

Any financial platform from the company would also face competition from PayPal and Venmo, which hold sizable positions in the market. And Musk’s own reputation could drive away some potential customers, much as his decisions at Twitter have reduced its user base.

Former employees have expressed skepticism about Musk’s plans for a financial platform in the past.

“There is a difference between having ambitions and a vision of the future you would like to see and a solid plan for how to achieve those things,” a former Twitter staffer with knowledge of the payments plan told Fortune in July. “My guess is Elon has traditionally relied on others to figure out the plan and execution. That’s not unusual for people who are futurists or visionaries.”

Despite the doubters, Musk expressed optimism about the project Thursday, telling workers, “It would blow my mind if we don’t have that rolled out by the end of next year.”","Elon Musk is celebrating one year of owning Twitter/X and has outlined ambitious plans to staff to become the epicenter of people's financial world.

General Motors announced Thursday that it is putting the brakes on its driverless cars, halting a service that provides driverless rides in multiple cities.

The move comes days after California revoked GM’s permits to test and operate fully driverless vehicles on the state’s roads.

The California DMV said the move was due in part to Cruise, GM’s self-driving vehicle technology subsidiary, withholding video and information about a crash in which a pedestrian was dragged by a Cruise vehicle after being struck first by a different hit-and-run driver.

“We have decided to proactively pause driverless operations across all of our fleets while we take time to examine our processes, systems, and tools and reflect on how we can better operate in a way that will earn public trust,” Cruise said late Thursday in a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter.

“This isn’t related to any new on-road incidents,” Cruise said. “We think it’s the right thing to do during a period when we need to be extra vigilant when it comes to risk, relentlessly focused on safety and taking steps to rebuild public trust.”

Besides operations in San Francisco that were suspended by authorities, Cruise was offering rides in driverless cars in Houston, Dallas and Austin, Texas, as well as Phoenix and Miami.

Cruise said it wil continue with “supervised AV operations,” which is its term for autonomous vehicle rides that have a human driver behind the wheel ready to take control of the vehicle should an emergency arise.

But fully driverless ride hailing services are a key to GM’s plan to eventually transform its business model, selling rides rather than vehicles to consumers and making more money off the vehicle during its operational life rather than through a straight sale soon after it is built.

GM said the driverless vehicles are safer than human-driven cars. The company has published a study claiming that it driverless cars are 65% less likely than human-driven cars to be involved in an accident and 74% less likely to be involved in a crash in which there is a meaningful risk of injury.

But there have been numerous problems with the vehicles’ operations. Earlier this month a pedestrian was critically injured underneath one of Cruise’s driverless car when after she was hit by a human-driven car, knocked into a different lane and then hit by the driverless car.

After striking the pedestrian, the Cruise vehicle, attempting to pull off the road and out of the way of traffic, dragged the pedestrian along the road for 20 feet at a speed at about seven miles an hour, according to the California DMV’s report.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has announced it has launched an investigation into the safety of its driverless vehicles around pedestrians.

There have also been reports of driverless Cruise taxis in San Fransciso coming to a halt and blocking some intersections for as much as 15 minutes, causing traffic jams.","GM has announced it is halting its driverless car service after California revoked the company's permits to test and operate fully driverless vehicles in the state. The move is a response to an incident involving a pedestrian being dragged by a Cruise vehicle after being hit by a different car, and other operational issues with the vehicles. The company will continue with supervised autonomous vehicle rides with a human driver ready to take control in an emergency."

Following several shaky periods in which Amazon worked to rightsize its business after rapidly expanding to meet the online demands of Covid, this was the second consecutive quarter results exceeded analysts’ expectations.

The results closely followed the usual pattern, with Amazon’s cloud service business, AWS, generating the bulk of its profits—$7 billion of the $11.2 billion total—while sales in its two retail businesses, online and physical, posted the slowest growth among its groups, at 7% and 6% respectively. Online sales remain the company’s largest revenue engine by far, generating $57.3 billion in the quarter.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that the decision to divide what was a single distribution network into eight regions is “exceeding [the company's] expectations.” He added that the change has “increased purchase frequency” and lowered costs for Amazon's online business.

The company’s third-party seller group had the largest sales gain in the quarter, with revenue up 20%, to $34.3 billion. The service is used by a host of different parties that fulfill book orders, and is one of the facets of Amazon’s business under fire from the antitrust lawsuit brought by the government earlier this fall.

The company’s forecast for fourth quarter results were met with mixed expectations by analysts, but still project sales growing 7%–12% compared with the fourth quarter last year. Operating income is expected to be between $7.0 billion and $11.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in last year's fourth quarter, which was a weak one by Amazon standards.","Amazon reported strong third quarter earnings with total sales increasing 13% to $143.1 billion and operating income soaring to $11.2 billion.

The Warren, Michigan-based company’s total revenue in the quarter was $421.3 million, a 17% year-over-year (y/y) decline, but beat Wall Street estimates of $420 million.

The company posted earnings per share of 88 cents, missing analysts’ estimates of $1. Third-quarter EPS decreased 52% y/y compared to the same period in 2022.

“The third quarter was a tale of two takes: Our contract logistics group navigated late-quarter market disruption with outstanding performance, while headwinds continue to hamper our intermodal and brokerage segments,” Phillips said during the company’s earnings call on Friday following the release of the results after the market closed on Thursday. “Our truckload segment outperformed expectations with a strong showing from a specialized services group.”

Universal Logistics (NASDAQ: ULH) provides truckload, brokerage, intermodal and dedicated services in the U.S., Mexico, Canada and Colombia.

In the trucking segment, third-quarter revenues decreased 2.5% to $97.1 million, compared to $99.6 million for the same period last year. Universal’s trucking segment tallied 43,996 loads, compared to 50,614 in the same year-ago period.





While truckload volume was down in the quarter, the average operating revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 13% y/y to $2,033. The number of tractors during the third quarter decreased about 2% y/y to 879, while the average length of haul fell 1.5% y/y to 388 miles.

“Van and flatbed headwinds continued in the third quarter for our trucking segment,” Phillips said. “While core flatbed and van volumes remain a challenge, our variable cost structure model provided consistent returns.”

Universal’s third-quarter intermodal revenue decreased 44% y/y to $86.6 million, affected by lower import volumes on the West Coast, Phillips said.

“Intermodal in California operations continue to be a drag on the segment’s overall financial result,” Phillips said. “While we are confident in our continued effort to right-size and optimize the intermodal fleet, freight volumes and pricing will play a part in that equation. Losses in Southern California affected our overall EPS by 19 cents per share.”

Universal Logistics’ third-quarter revenue in its company-managed brokerage segment decreased 30.8% to $28.1 million, compared to $40.6 million for the same year-ago period.

“Company-managed brokerage dropped 30.8% … amid a sluggish freight market influenced by inflation and consumer spending that continued to drive down pricing,” Phillips said.

Phillips said the company is optimistic about freight-hauling opportunities improving in the Mexico cross-border automotive space, as well as loads in the Class 8 truck manufacturing market.

Universal Logistics is working with a customer that launched manufacturing operations in Mexico in October.

“Universal remains focused on the opportunities that Mexico presents as nearshoring trends have now elevated Mexico as the United States’ largest import trading partner,” Phillips said. “We are extremely excited about adding to our density in central Mexico. We were successful in obtaining new trucks and trailers to support the customer and expect this to be an entry into additional business in the region. The program will be over a five-week period and be supported by 40 drivers and 60 trailers. This new business is expected to generate approximately $6 million in annual revenue.”

An 11th Circuit panel in Atlanta has upheld a class action settlement in a $2.7 billion antitrust case against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which means benefits will now be distributed to the subscribers who sued Blue Cross more than a decade ago.

The plaintiffs, in their suit, had accused the health insurer of Sherman Antitrust Act violations, including limiting competition between its 36 insurer companies, which in turn resulted in a price hike for members.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

The three-judge panel's decision upholds the Alabama District Court's August 2022 approval of the settlement. Actions against Blue Cross were consolidated in Alabama and split into a track for subscribers and one for healthcare providers; District Court Judge R. David Proctor imposed terms on Blues plans that change the way they operate in such a way as to boost competition among insurers.

That, however, resulted in appeals to the 11th Circuit, including from Home Depot, which said the agreement violates public policy and would harm the power of antitrust enforcers to bring claims against Blue Cross in the future. That, said Home Depot, is because the agreement includes a release of future antitrust class claims originating from Blue Cross.

The court disagreed, saying the appeal does not affect public enforcement of antitrust laws or bar the federal government from pursuing criminal charges or civil claims against the insurer.

Another appeal, from consulting firms Topographic and Employee Services, took issue with the lower court's plan to distribute the monetary awards, saying the larger, self-funded subclass in the suit would only be awarded 6.5% of the funds, with the lion's share going to the fully insured subscriber class.

The 11th Circuit disagreed, writing in the ruling that the allocation was ""unequal"" but not ""unfair,"" as it was based on the relative strengths of each class's antitrust claims, and the competitiveness of the fully insured market.

The deal does not resolve claims from companies that opted out of the class action and are pursuing their own lawsuits. Health providers also have pending claims.

THE LARGER TREND

The District Court decision was handed down in August 2022. The settlement resolves claims that the insurers violated antitrust laws by entering into an agreement not to compete with each other and to limit competition among themselves in selling health insurance, according to the BCBS settlement website. BCBS has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.

In October 2020, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies said they had reached an agreement to settle a legal dispute challenging elements of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association licensing agreements.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is a national federation of 35 independent, community-based and locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies.

In November 2020, Anthem said it would pay $594 million as its share of the antitrust settlement. Anthem operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,MOAA - TransUnion Payout to Include Military Personnel Affected by ...,https://www.moaa.org/content/publications-and-media/news-articles/2023-news-articles/finance/transunion-payout-to-include-military-personnel-affected-by-company-lapses/,"This article by Kyle Alvarez originally appeared on Stripes.com. Stars and Stripes serves the U.S. military community by providing editorially independent news and information around the world.

One of the three major American credit bureaus will pay $8 million for not taking required steps to prevent active-duty service members and other U.S. consumers from landing on prescreened lists for insurance and credit card solicitations, among other lapses.

TransUnion also was ordered by the U.S. government to fix its broken practices, which resulted in failure by the company and two subsidiaries to process freezes and locks on people’s credit reports on time, according to a statement from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The $8 million total consists of a $5 million fine and up to $3 million in consumer compensation. TransUnion will contact affected consumers regarding the payout, so there is no need for them to act on their own, the bureau statement said.

[RELATED: Military Community at Higher Risk of Payment App Scams]

Security freezes and locks are designed to minimize the risk of identity theft by preventing third parties from gaining access to consumers’ credit reports. Scammers can use the information in the reports to open fraudulent accounts.

Since at least 2003, TransUnion failed to institute or remove security locks and freezes in a timely manner for tens of thousands of consumers, according to a bureau order issued Oct. 10.

“These consumers did not know about this failure, and some were told that their requests had been honored when they had not,” the order said.

[RELATED: Don’t Let Summer Cyber-Travel Scams Spoil Your Vacation]

Because of reliability issues with TransUnion’s systems, customer requests sometimes had to be registered by hand, but the credit bureau didn’t keep up with demand, according to the order.

Those systems issues, which were known to TransUnion, “steadily accumulated and were left unresolved for years,” the order said.

Active-duty military personnel who requested extension of the precautions were among the people affected, as TransUnion “failed to continue to exclude those consumers from marketing lists for prescreened offers,” according to the CFPB.

It said demand for credit freezes and locks exploded in the wake of a 2017 breach at rival credit bureau Equifax that compromised the personal data of an estimated 147 million Americans.

[MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES: MOAA.org/Finance]

Another problem that TransUnion let fester, the report said, was differing database information for the same person. In the company’s terminology, the databases were out of sync, and this affected both the placement and removal of freezes and locks.

As a result, consumers whose credit reports were not frozen or locked despite their requests may have had that information passed to a third party, while people who wanted to remove a lock or freeze may have been denied credit because their TransUnion file was inaccessible to lenders, according to the report.

In addition, TransUnion sent “standard, automatically generated confirmation messages” to consumers saying their request was successful, regardless of the outcome. So many of them didn’t discover a problem until later, the report said.

Errors pertaining to active-duty alerts and extended fraud alerts were identified in a 2018 audit, but TransUnion regarded them as low risk and left the problem unresolved for over a year, the bureau wrote in the report.

[RELATED: Report Shines Light on Why Scammers Target Servicemembers and Veterans]

An active-duty alert is supposed to provide a two-year exclusion for military personnel from lists given to third parties for the purpose of credit or insurance solicitations. About 32,000 consumers were affected by these errors, the report said.","TransUnion, one of three major credit bureaus, will pay $8 million for failing to take necessary steps to protect U.S. consumers, particularly active-duty military personnel, from landing on prescreened lists for insurance and credit card offers. The bureau has ordered TransUnion to fix its broken practices, which resulted in failure to process freezes and locks on people’s credit reports on time. Affected consumers will be contacted regarding the payout, and the company has been given a year to implement the fixes."
2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,"Bitcoin Price Rises, Seasonal Trend Points to More Increases | Money",https://money.com/bitcoin-price-best-time-of-year/,"After a rough year for cryptocurrency prices (and investing in general), bitcoin has been clawing its way back up. Prices for the most famous cryptocurrency have risen from $16,625 in January all the way to over $34,000 in October, including an increase of around 30% over the past month. And now we are entering a time when it seems like bitcoin has historically performed the strongest.

The crypto asset's price has often seen significant spikes in the fourth quarter of the year, suggesting a seasonal trend for bitcoin prices. In 2016, for example, bitcoin gained 63% from the beginning of October to the end of December. In 2017, it gained 267% in that same time frame. In fact, between 2016 and 2021, the crypto has gained an average of 25% in October, 8% in November and 11% in December, according to data by investing research company Bespoke Investing Group.

This gives a lot of hope for investors that bitcoin can add onto its recent surge. But no one can accurately predict where volatile investments like crypto are headed at any given time, and some experts question whether there's any truth to the theory that bitcoin prices often get a bump toward the end of the year.

Do bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year?

The numbers indicate that the fourth quarter has been historically favorable for bitcoin prices. But experts have not come to a consensus on why or even if bitcoin prices often surge in the fall.

A popular theory is that crypto buyers, just like stock investors, are apt to trade heavily toward the end of the calendar year. Bitwise Asset Management’s chief investment officer, Matthew Hougan, previously told Money that while investors are looking to strategize their portfolios for the year’s end, lots of money has tended to end up in crypto allocations.

Others say it’s just too early to draw any conclusions about bitcoin pricing trends. Omid Malekan, crypto expert and adjunct professor at Columbia University's Business School, tells Money that he’s “not certain if bitcoin has a strong seasonal trend or if it's coincidental.”

Crypto may be over a decade old, but it’s still infantile compared to other assets like stocks or bonds. This lack of sufficient data, Malekan says, makes it difficult to assess the validity of any crypto trends.

Malekan says bitcoin is defined by “eras” perhaps more so than seasonal trends. “The last bull market and crash were driven by central bank liquidity and fears about inflation and the resulting monetary tightening,” he says. These eras are not seasonal trends that hold up over time, but rather shorter-lived events driven by investor behavior.

Do bitcoin prices and stocks rise and fall together?

But wait, don’t stocks often rise in the fourth quarter as well? That’s true. As it turns out, bitcoin prices and stocks are likely more linked than you might expect. And this relationship could be what gives some credence to the idea of bitcoin price seasonality.

In February, researchers at Georgetown University discovered that a correlation between cryptocurrency prices and the stock market continues to grow stronger. Specifically, they find that price movement of bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index are correlated, and continue to become more so. They said that the linkage “may reflect the fact that the two markets are becoming more connected, as institutional investors increasingly enter the crypto world.”

While the reasons why the two investments follow the same price patterns aren't totally understood yet, it would make sense that crypto is prone to the same kind of selloffs that happen in the stock market.

If this is true, then there is reason to believe that bitcoin prices tend to rise at the end of the year at least partly because stocks also frequently rise at the end of the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted an average gain of 4.2% in the last quarter of the year. That's twice as good as the next best-performing first quarter, which averages a return of 2.1%. And just like how September is typically a bad month for bitcoin prices, it is also historically one of the worst months for stock performance.

Where are bitcoin prices heading now?

If the theory that bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year holds true, the crypto could continue its recent hot run. However, as the saying goes: Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Last year, the coin dropped by 12.3% over the course of the fourth quarter. Of course, bitcoin’s 2022 was marked by losses throughout the entirety of the year, with the crypto losing 66% over 12 months. In retrospect, banking on a strong end of the year in 2022 would have proved foolish. Ultimately, the October-December period was bitcoin's second-worst quarter in 2022.

With wind behind bitcoin's sails this year, though, as well as building excitement over likely upcoming changes in crypto investing options, many experts have voiced bullish predictions for the near term.

“We’re one step closer to a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors are optimistic that an approval could happen fairly soon,” says Anthony Georgiades, general partner at investing fund Innovation Capital. “There’s also much anticipation about the next bitcoin halving, which typically serves as a catalyst for bull markets.”

A bitcoin ETF is an investment fund made up of bitcoin or bitcoin-related companies. Right now, bitcoin ETFs only consist of futures contracts, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. Investing companies Fidelity and BlackRock are both waiting for approval for their spot bitcoin ETFs, which would be the first ETFs to contain bitcoin itself. Bitcoin halving, meanwhile, is a process in which the rate at which coins are released is cut in half; it happens every four years, and the next halving is expected in spring of 2024.

Others say that the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 2024 is also driving optimism. Zachary Townsend, CEO of crypto company Meanwhile, says “the cost of servicing the existing and new debt will simply be too high"" for the Fed to avoid cutting its rates.

One consequence of this, Townsend says, is ""debasement of the currency,"" or a drop in value of the U.S. dollar. ""It’s in these kinds of environments in particular, when fiat currency is getting debased, that bitcoin performs best.”

The FTC’s Safeguards Rule requires non-banking financial institutions, such as mortgage brokers, motor vehicle dealers, and payday lenders, to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive security program to keep their customers’ information safe. In October 2021, the FTC announced it had finalized changes to the Safeguards Rule to strengthen the data security safeguards that financial institutions are required to put in place to protect their customers’ financial information. The FTC also sought comment on a proposed supplemental amendment to the Safeguards Rule that would require financial institutions to report certain data breaches and other security events to the Commission.

“Companies that are trusted with sensitive financial information need to be transparent if that information has been compromised,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The addition of this disclosure requirement to the Safeguards Rule should provide companies with additional incentive to safeguard consumers’ data.”

The amendment announced today requires financial institutions to notify the FTC as soon as possible, and no later than 30 days after discovery, of a security breach involving the information of at least 500 consumers. Such an event requires notification if unencrypted customer information has been acquired without the authorization of the individual to which the information pertains. The notice to the FTC must include certain information about the event, such as the number of consumers affected or potentially affected.

The breach notification requirement becomes effective 180 days after publication of the rule in the Federal Register.

The Commission voted 3-0 to publish the notice amending the Safeguards Rule in the Federal Register.

It excludes tools and equipment temporarily used during construction, as well as equipment and furnishings that are not considered an integral or final component of the project.

The agency also defined the Buy America parameters for-profit organizations in the running for infrastructure financial assistance.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,"PRA, FCA and BoE publish feedback on AI and Machine Learning in ...",https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/pra-fca-and-boe-publish-feedback-on-ai-1675178/,"[co-author: Alex Nicol]

On 26 October 2023, the Bank of England (BoE) (including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (collectively ‘the regulators’) published a feedback statement summarising the responses to the joint discussion paper (DP5/22) on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning which was published in October 2022. DP5/22 aims to understand how AI may affect the prudential and conduct supervision of financial services firms.

The joint AI and machine learning feedback statement (PRA FS2/23/ FCA FS23/6) provides a summary of the responses to the October 2022 Discussion Paper on AI and machine learning (DP5/22).

The aim of the feedback is to acknowledge and summarise the responses to DP5/22 and identify the main themes emerging from the feedback. It does not include policy proposals but it suggests the regulatory direction of travel and flags how firms are prioritising AI risks and approaching creating AI governance frameworks. DP5/22 received 54 responses from regulated firms, trade bodies, and non-financial businesses. The regulators state that there was no significant divergence of opinion between sectors.

DP5/22 is part of the supervisory authorities’ wider programme of work related to AI, including the AI Public Private Forum (AIPPF), and its final report published in February 2022.

Supervisory authorities’ objectives and remits

Would a financial services sector-specific AI definition be beneficial?

Chapter 2 of DP5/22 outlined the regulators’ objectives and remits, and their relevance to the use of AI in financial services. It surveyed existing approaches by regulators and authorities to distinguishing between AI and non-AI. Some approaches provide a legal definition of AI (for example as seen in the proposed EU AI Act), whereas other approaches have instead identified the key characteristics of AI (for example the UK AI White Paper). DP5/22 asked respondents whether a financial services sector-specific regulatory definition would be beneficial and whether there are other effective approaches that do not rely on a definition.

Most respondents thought that a regulatory definition of AI would not be useful for the following reasons: (i) a definition could become quickly outdated due to the pace of technology development, (ii) definitions could be too broad (i.e. cover non-AI systems) or too narrow (i.e. would fail to cover all the use cases), (iii) a definition could create incentives for regulatory arbitrage, and (iv) creating a sectoral regulatory definition could be in conflict with the regulatory authorities’ technology-neutral approach. Those in the minority that were in favour of a definition suggested that it would help prevent the inconsistent interpretation or implementation. Many respondents pointed to the use of alternative, principles-based or risk-based approaches to the definition of AI with a focus on specific characteristics of AI or risks posed or amplified by AI.

Focus should be proportionate and on the outcomes affecting consumers

Most respondents suggested that a technology-neutral, outcomes-based, and principles-based approach would be effective in supporting the safe and responsible adoption of AI in financial services. The regulatory focus should be on the outcomes affecting consumers and markets rather than on specific technologies. This outcome-focused approach is in line with the approach of existing regulation, namely, that firms should ensure good outcomes and effective oversight whether or not AI is used in the process. In particular, one respondent suggested that indicators of better outcomes for customers could include the factors already set out by the Consumer Duty. The approach to AI should be proportionate to the risks associated with, or materiality of each specific AI application.

Some respondents welcomed further guidance on the interpretation and evaluation of good consumer outcomes in the AI context with respect to existing sectoral regulations such as the FCA’s Consumer Duty. Guidance on preventing, evaluating, and mitigating bias, with case studies to help illustrate best practice would also be welcomed. Guidance on the use of personal data in AI in the financial services context, supported by case studies to demonstrate what good looks like was also suggested by respondents.

Potential benefits and risks of the use of AI in financial services

There are a wide range of benefits of AI in financial services for example driving better consumer outcomes, more personalised advice, lower costs, and better prices. DP5/22 also invited responses on potential risks and risk mitigation strategies including those set out below.

Consumer protection

A majority of respondents cited consumer protection as an area for the supervisory authorities to prioritise. Respondents said that AI could create risks such as bias, discrimination, lack of explainability, transparency, and exploiting vulnerable consumers or consumers with protected characteristics.

Market integrity and financial stability

Commenting on market integrity and financial stability, respondents highlighted that the speed and scale of AI could increase the potential for (new forms of) systemic risks, such as interconnectivity between AI systems and the potential for AI-induced firm failures. Respondents mentioned the following potential risks to financial markets: (i) emergence of new forms of market manipulation, (ii) the use of deepfakes for misinformation potentially destabilising financial markets, (iii) third-party AI models resulting in convergent models including digital collusion or herding, and (iv) AI could amplify flash crashes or automated market disruptions.

Governance

On governance, while most respondents said that existing firm governance structures are either already sufficient to cover AI or are being adapted by firms to make them sufficient there are concerns that there will be still be risks related to insufficient oversight. Some respondents noted that there may not be sufficient skills and experience within firms to support the level of oversight required to ensure technical (for example data and model risks) and non-technical (for example consumer and market outcomes) risk management. Some respondents noted that a lack of technical expertise is especially worrying given the increased adoption of third-party AI software. Some respondents also pointed out the importance of human-in-the-loop for mitigating risks associated with overreliance on AI or overconfidence in the accuracy of AI.

Operational resilience and outsourcing

Respondents suggested that third-party providers of AI solutions should provide evidence supporting the responsible development, independent validation, and ongoing governance of their AI products, providing firms with sufficient information to make their own risk assessment. Respondents argued that third party providers do not always provide sufficient information to enable effective governance of some of their products. Given the scope and ubiquity of third-party AI applications, respondents commented that the risks posed by third party exposure could lead to an increase in systemic risks. Some respondents said that not all firms have the necessary expertise to conduct adequate due diligence of third-party AI applications and models.

Fraud and money laundering

Respondents suggested that as the technology develops, there may also be increased access of AI tools by bad actors who wish to use AI for fraud and money laundering. For example, respondents noted that generative AI can easily be exploited to create deepfakes as a way to commit fraud. The technology may make such fraud more sophisticated, greater in scale and harder to detect. This may in turn create risks to consumers and, if sufficient in magnitude, financial stability.

Some respondents noted that the adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) may increase rapidly in financial services. Respondents noted that the risks associated with the use of GenAI are not fully understood, especially risks related to bias, accuracy, reliability, and explainability. Due to ‘hallucinations’ in GenAI outputs, respondents also suggested that there may be risks to firms and consumers relying on or trusting GenAI as a source of financial advice or information.

Legal requirements or guidance relevant to AI

Respondents remarked that, while existing regulation is sufficient to cover risks associated with AI, there are areas where clarificatory guidance on the application of existing regulation is needed (such as accountability of different parties in outsourcing) and areas of novel risk that may require further guidance in the future. Some respondents suggested that guidance on best practices for responsible AI development and deployment would help firms ensure that they are adopting AI in a safe and responsible manner. AI capabilities change rapidly. Regulators could respond by designing and maintaining ‘live’ regulatory guidance for example periodically updated guidance and examples of best practice. Specific areas of law and regulation that might be adapted to address AI are summarised below.

Operational resilience

A number of respondents stressed the relevance and importance to AI of the existing regulatory framework relating to operational resilience and outsourcing, including the PRA’s supervisory statements (SS) 1/21 – Operational resilience: Impact tolerances for important business services and SS2/21 – Outsourcing and third party risk management, as well as the FCA’s PS21/3 – Building operational resilience. Respondents also noted the relevance of the Bank, the PRA and the FCA’s DP3/22 – Operational resilience: Critical third parties to the UK financial sector.

SMCR in an AI context

Most respondents did not think that creating a new Prescribed Responsibility (PR) for AI to be allocated to a Senior Management Function (SMF) would be helpful for enhancing effective governance of AI. Most respondents thought that further guidance on how to interpret the ‘reasonable steps’ element of the SM&CR in an AI context would be helpful, although only if it was practical or actionable guidance.

Regulatory alignment

Some respondents noted legal and regulatory developments in other jurisdictions (including the proposed EU AI Act), and argued that international regulatory harmonisation would be beneficial, where possible, particularly for multinational firms. One respondent noted that the development of adequate and flexible cooperation mechanisms supporting information-sharing (or lessons learnt) across jurisdictions could also minimise barriers and facilitate beneficial innovation.

Data regulation

Respondents highlighted legal requirements and guidance relating to data protection. One respondent noted that the way the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) interacts with AI might mean that automated decision making could potentially be prohibited. One response noted regulatory guidance indicating that the 'right to erasure' under the UK GDPR extends to personal data used to train AI models, which could prove challenging in practice given the limited extent to which developers are able to separate and remove training data from a trained AI model. Other respondents argue that, although it is generally recognised that data protection laws apply to the use of AI, there may be a lack of understanding by suppliers, developers, and users, leading to those actors potentially gaming or ignoring the rules. Most respondents argued that there are areas of data regulation that are not sufficient to identify, manage, monitor, and control the risks associated with AI models. Some pointed to insufficient regulation on the topics of data access, data protection, and data privacy (for example to monitor bias). Some respondents thought that regulation in relation to data quality, data management, and operations are insufficient.

Several respondents sought clarification on what bias and fairness could mean in the context of AI models, more specifically, they asked how firms should interpret the Equality Act 2010 and the FCA Consumer Duty in this context. Other respondents asked for more clarity on how data protection / privacy rights interact with AI techniques.

Open banking was suggested as a way of improving data access within financial services and thus facilitate innovation with AI and competition. Lack of access to high-quality data may be a barrier to entry for firms’ adoption of AI. Open banking may help create a more level playing field by providing firms with larger and more diverse datasets, and therefore enabling more effective competition.

Cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdictional coordination on AI

Many respondents emphasised the importance of cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdictional coordination as AI is a cross-cutting technology extending across sectoral boundaries. As a consequence, respondents encouraged authorities to ensure coherence and consistency in regulatory approaches across sectoral regulators, such as aligning key principles, metrics, and interpretation of key concepts. Some respondents suggested that the supervisory authorities work with other regulators to reduce and/or prevent regulatory overlaps and clarify the role of sectoral regulations and legislation.

Next steps

As set out in the responses to DP5/22, since many regulated firms operate in multiple jurisdictions, an internationally coordinated and harmonised regulatory response on AI is critical in ensuring that UK regulation does not put UK firms and markets at a disadvantage. Minimising fragmentation and operational complexity will therefore be key. The supervisory authorities should support collaboration between financial services firms, regulators, academia, and technology practitioners with the aim of promoting competition. Respondents also noted that encouraging firms to collaborate in the development and deployment of AI, such as sharing knowledge and resources, could help reduce costs and improve the quality of AI systems for financial services. Ongoing industry engagement will clearly be important as the regulatory framework for AI continues to develop. We will be closely monitoring developments so please do get in touch with our financial services regulatory and technology specialists listed on the right hand side with any questions.",") implementation of AI and machine learning systems (ML), and ii) the use of AI in the context of the principles-based regime and the regulators’ expectations. For example, the regulators should provide guidance on the application of principles in the context of AI and ML, explain what is expected of firms in terms of governance and oversight of AI, and provide further guidance on how firms should assess the risks posed by AI and ML systems.This feedback statement summarises the responses to the October 2022 Discussion Paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which aimed to understand how AI may affect the prudential and conduct supervision of financial services firms. The responses suggest that a technology-neutral, outcomes-based, and principles-based approach would be effective in supporting the safe and responsible adoption of AI in financial services, with a focus on the outcomes affecting consumers and markets rather than on specific technologies. The regulators should provide further guidance on the application of principles in the context of AI and ML, and how firms should assess the risks posed by AI and ML systems."

According to a new report by The Verge, the business magnate says he expects X’s comprehensive financial features to roll out by the end of 2024 and compete with traditional banks.

As stated by Musk in a company-wide meeting, according to an audio recording obtained by The Verge,

“When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial life. If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank account…

It would blow my mind if we don’t have that rolled out by the end of next year.”

Currently, X is working on obtaining the proper licenses to be able to operate its financial services in the US, according to the report. There was no mention of Dogecoin in the call. However, since Musk is a well-known DOGE fan, Musk’s involvement in financial services tends to excite DOGE holders.

Last month, Musk shut down rumors of creating a crypto asset called “X Coin” as a means of rewarding content creators over the social media platform.

At the time, an X account claimed that the platform was going to create a digital asset specifically for rewarding users. Musk replied to the message with a simple “no,” shooting down the idea.

Meanwhile, DOGE has been flying this week, along with the rest of the crypto markets. The dog-themed memecoin went from $0.058 on October 19th to a peak of $0.74 on October 26th. Dogecoin has since retraced and is moving for $0.69 at time of writing.

Dr. Bak Barnaba Chol refers to the unregulated interest rates prevailing in the market, where difficult-to-repay loans are often granted, forcing beneficiaries to term them as “Cancer, Ebola and Corona”.

Dr. Bak urged lenders to adhere to the rules set by the Bank of South Sudan when providing loans to individuals.

While admitting the severity of the issue, Minister Bak said such loan practices are deemed illegal and must be discontinued immediately.

The minister’s warning aims to send a clear message to all lenders that profiting at the expense of vulnerable individuals through illegal interest rates will not be tolerated.

Speaking during the launching ceremony of Association of Microfinance in South Sudan in Juba, Dr. Bak said the Central Bank clearly indicates that interest rates must be between 12 and 15 percent of the amount borrowed.

“Now days there are illegal interest rate in the markets. There are Cancer, Ebola and Corona. These are illegal interest rate, and we are supposed to follow the Bank of South Sudan laws where the interest rate is clearly indicated as 12% or 15%,” he said.

He added: “Nobody is allowed to go beyond the pronounced interest by the Central Bank that’s the most important thing.”

Dr. Bak is calling on lenders to adhere to the regulations set by the Bank of South Sudan to eradicate exploitative lending practices and safeguard the interests of borrowers.

According to reports, illegal interest rates on loans have been a growing concern in South Sudan’s financial sector.

These rates, locally referred to as “Cancer, Ebola, and Corona” loans due to their detrimental impact on borrowers, are causing major financial burdens and hardships for individuals seeking financial assistance.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,ED Publishes New Rules on Financial Responsibility and Transcript ...,https://www.nacubo.org/News/2023/10/ED%20Publishes%20New%20Rules%20on%20Financial%20Responsibility%20and%20Transcript%20Withholding,"On October 24, the Department of Education published a final regulation addressing several topics on its regulatory agenda, including financial responsibility, administrative capability, certification procedures, and Ability to Benefit.

Details of the final rule, which will be published in the Federal Register on October 31, will go into effect on July 1, 2024. ED also published a three-page fact sheet summarizing the final rule.

ED notes in a press release that the rule is intended to meet the Biden administration’s agenda “to make college more affordable, hold colleges accountable, and protect taxpayers and consumers.”

NACUBO’s summary below examines the provisions addressing financial responsibility and certification procedures, including transcript withholding policies. NACUBO staff will continue to review the regulation and will work with other higher education associations to determine ways colleges and universities will implement the changes.

Financial Responsibility Provisions

Overall, ED retained almost all financial responsibility items that were in its May negotiated rulemaking proposal. However,

ED retracted proposed requirements for institutions to disclose all recruitment, advertising, and pre-enrollment expenses and extended the triggering event reporting timeframe from 10 to 21 days. Both changes were recommendations NACUBO made.

The final rule supports ED’s stance that mandatory triggering events are directly linked to finances and signal significant financial concern; consequently, surety and ongoing engagement can be required. Some examples of mandatory triggers include legal actions and related costs, borrower defense claims, financial exigency, and equity withdrawals. However, the final rule narrows the scope of the teach-out trigger and adds a composite score recalculation for ownership changes and certain monetary obligations from legal and administrative actions. With discretionary triggering events, the rule provides institutions an opportunity to share additional information that demonstrates resolution or risk reduction.

Concerning related party disclosure requirements, ED clarified that de minimus routine transactions, such as meals for trustees, should not be considered. Another clarification requires institutions without related party transactions to add a note to the financial statements that discloses this fact. However, ED retained its regulatory requirement for institutions to identify individual related parties and transaction totals in a note to the financial statements. ED believes that because such information is provided solely for its use, there is no conflict with OMB rules that prohibits the disclosure of identifying information about individuals. NACUBO had expressed concerns that ED’s reasoning runs contrary to the principles of public transparency inherent in the Single Audit and Freedom of Information Acts.

Transcript Withholding Policies

Within the certification procedure provisions, ED made changes to its Program Participation Agreements with institutions to prohibit withholding transcripts in certain circumstances.

First, institutions cannot withhold transcripts—or take other negative actions against a student—in cases where a debt on a student’s account is created because of an error made by the institution in administering Title IV funds, or when there is fraud or misconduct by the institution or its employees.

Second, an institution will have to provide an official transcript to a student for payment periods when the student received Title IV aid and all institutional charges for that payment period were paid or included in an agreement to pay. This is a departure from ED’s proposal, which suggested that institutions would not be able to withhold transcripts in cases where a debt that caused the hold was the result of a Return to Title IV (R2T4) calculation. NACUBO had objected to this in our letter, and ED scrapped that R2T4 proposal, adopting instead the broader Title IV approach. It is unclear at this time whether “agreement to pay” simply means institutional payment plans or promise-to-pay provisions included in college and university Student Financial Responsibility Agreements.

The final regulation suggests that institutions will be able to utilize other existing methods of collecting a balance on a student’s account.

The publication of the final rule completes a process that began in the winter of 2021-22 with public hearings and negotiated rulemaking sessions, with proposed regulations shared in May 2023.

Separately, ED published final regulations on September 28 addressing the gainful employment and financial value transparency provisions that were part of this regulatory package.","s aspect of the proposed rule.The Department of Education published a final regulation addressing topics such as financial responsibility, administrative capability, certification procedures, and Ability to Benefit, with the aim of making college more affordable, holding colleges accountable, and protecting taxpayers and consumers.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Fallout co-creator settles over two decades of fan debate about who ...,https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-co-creator-settles-over-two-decades-of-fan-debate-about-who-nuked-who-with-a-single-off-hand-comment-on-a-podcast/,"Tim Cain is a storied man. Fallout co-creator, Arcanum maker, owner and proprietor of the best channel on YouTube, Cain's accolades stretch beyond counting, and there are more game design secrets locked up in his head than we'll probably ever know. But hey, we can know some of them, and thanks to Cain's recent appearance on gaming documentary channel TKs-Mantis (via GamesRadar), we know one about Fallout specifically: Who was it that dropped the first bomb?

Chatting off the cuff about the moral ambiguity of Fallout's foundational conflict, Cain happened to mention that ""The reason [the United States] got nuked is bio-weapons were illegal, and somehow China found out we were doing FEV."" The FEV, if you're not up on your Fallout lore, is the Forced Evolutionary Virus, a pre-war supersoldier serum that was used to make the Super Mutants of Fallout 1.

But the important thing is Cain referring to it as ""the reason [the US] got nuked."" Ever since Fallout 1, the question of whether America or China shot first has been a source of fan debate. Turns out it was China. So that's that. 26 years of argument settled because Tim Cain went on a podcast.

Mantis immediately picked up on it. ""Earth-shattering, what you just said,"" chuckled the host, informing a surprised Cain that ""people actually debate over who shot first, like a Greedo, Solo thing.""

""Oh they do?"" asked a sheepish Cain, ""Well then I don't know. Who knows? It was probably some rogue nation."" A flawless recovery, really.

To be fair, Fallout's lore is entirely in Bethesda's hands these days, and that studio has gone on to do all sorts of weird stuff—from aliens to replicants—during its stewardship of the series. It could well be that the backstory Cain and co settled on back in the '90s is no longer official canon at Bethesda.

But, well, it probably is: it's been generally accepted among Fallout fans that China is the most likely nation to have shot first in Fallout's eschatological origin story, based on evidence you can uncover across the entire series, Bethesda's games included. Cain's off-the-cuff admittance of that fact is only going to solidify that theory as canon going forward.","Tim Cain, co-creator of Fallout, revealed on a podcast that the US was nuked by China due to the development of the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). This is something that has been debated for 26 years but Cain's statement cements the theory that China was the nation to drop the first bomb in Fallout's eschatological origin story."

Democrats Mary Lou Rinaldi and Geoff Alswanger are seeking reelection to the board. Democrat Laura Burwick, who was appointed to fill a vacancy on the board last year, and Republican Thomas Kuczynski are also running.

What do you believe will be the biggest challenge the Board of Finance faces in the next four years, and how should the board tackle that issue?

Rebuilding our city infrastructure to meet the current and future needs of Stamford will be the biggest challenge facing the city of Stamford over the next four years. This means not only catching up to the backlog of roads and bridges that need to be rebuilt but planning for expansion in areas that suffer from congestion today.

Included as part of the essential infrastructure is building new schools and significantly renovating others. We have an ambitious vision for achieving rebuilt schools in Stamford and achieving that vision will require strong fiscal discipline. Financing the city share of the school construction as well as meeting the significant cash flow requirements involved in receiving state funding will require significant planning and oversight by the Board of Finance.

What else would be your top priorities as a board member?

The Board of Finance plays a critical role in overseeing the finances of the city, thereby balancing the needs of the taxpayers with the demands of a growing community. Reviewing and acting on budgets set forth by the mayor is an essential role. The Board of Finance provides accountability to ensure the city is meeting its financial reporting obligations, provides accurate governance data and makes well-informed financial decisions. Accomplishing this function is a critical check and balance on the power of city government.

I also served as interim director of operations.

What do you believe will be the biggest challenge the Board of Finance faces in the next four years, and how should the board tackle that issue?

The city is embarking on a 20-year $1.5 billion plan to renovate or replace all of its existing schools. The Board of Finance will need to ensure there are adequate funds in place to construct four new schools and renovate the remaining ones. We are fortunate that the state has agreed to fund up to 80 percent of (eligible) costs for Westhill High School and up to 60 percent for the remaining schools.

The Board of Finance will need to analyze the city’s cash flow models, approve funding and ensure that state reimbursement dollars are maximized. Furthermore, we will need to carefully manage our bonding to preserve the city's debt rating.

What else would be your top priorities as a board member?

Keep taxes as low as possible while maintaining quality city services.

Ensure that the city puts policies and procedures in place for its accounting of revenues and expenses and adheres to them.

Maintain pressure on the city to complete its much-delayed annual audit and ensure that steps are taken to mitigate future audit delays.

What do you believe will be the biggest challenge the Board of Finance faces in the next four years, and how should the board tackle that issue?

I believe the biggest challenge facing the Board of Finance in the short- to mid-term is the construction and financing of our crumbling schools. While the state of Connecticut has graciously offered Stamford 80 percent reimbursement for the construction of a new Westhill High School and 60 percent reimbursement for the construction of (other new schools) over 25 years, Stamford still has to (cover) “up-front” construction costs while waiting for state reimbursements, which will be a financial balancing act.

At a projected overall cost of approximately $1.6 billion in a very high-interest borrowing environment, the Board of Finance has had to develop a school construction funding strategy while still paying for all of the other capital project demands in the city. The current board has already set aside (funding) in each of the past two operating budgets, with plans to do the same in future operating budgets. This year-over-year increasing fund balance will help pay for some of the up-front school construction costs without the city having to bond for it. This strategy will save the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest.

Going forward, the finance board will also have to stagger construction schedules to use state reimbursements to pay for new construction. As one who has been involved in this strategy from the beginning, I am running for reelection to see this large municipal undertaking through to a successful conclusion.

What else would be your top priorities as a board member?

As the finance board’s Audit Committee chair, I have been concerned that the city’s 2021 audit was delayed six months and the 2022 audit is overdue 10-plus months. I have been vocal on this issue and am working with the mayor and director of administration to identify “the why, where and who” of these problems and to get the new audit preparation on track. If re-elected, this would be a high priority issue, ensuring that the city’s financial position/reporting is correct, transparent and available to the credit rating agencies. Maintenance of Stamford’s AAA rating is imperative so we can borrow at the most attractive interest rates.","oru top priorities as a board member?As a board member, I will prioritize maintaining and enhancing the city's financial health.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,PBGC Approves SFA Application for Local 210’s Plan,https://www.pbgc.gov/news/press/releases/pr23-047,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) announced today that it has approved the application submitted to the Special Financial Assistance (SFA) Program by the Local 210’s Pension Plan (Local 210’s Plan). The plan, based in New York City, New York, covers 3,887 participants in the transportation industry.

The Local 210’s Plan will receive approximately $49.3 million in special financial assistance, including interest to the expected date of payment to the plan. The plan was projected to become insolvent and run out of money in 2026. Without the SFA Program, the Local 210’s Plan would have been required to reduce participants’ benefits to the PBGC guarantee level upon plan insolvency, which is roughly 10 percent below the benefits payable under the terms of the plan. SFA will enable the plan to continue to pay retirement benefits without reduction for many years into the future.

“Millions of people work for years, looking forward to the day when the promise of a secure, dignified retirement is kept,” said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su. “Today, the Biden-Harris administration is delivering on that promise for 3,887 transportation workers in New York by providing Special Financial Assistance to the Local 210’s Pension Plan.""

About the Special Financial Assistance Program

The SFA Program was enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021. The program provides funding to severely underfunded multiemployer pension plans and will ensure that millions of America’s workers, retirees, and their families receive the pension benefits they earned.

The SFA Program requires plans to demonstrate eligibility for SFA and to calculate the amount of assistance pursuant to ARP and PBGC’s regulations. SFA and earnings thereon must be segregated from other plan assets and may be used only to pay plan benefits and administrative expenses. Plans are not obligated to repay SFA to PBGC. Plans receiving SFA are also subject to certain terms, conditions and reporting requirements, including an annual statement documenting compliance with the terms and conditions. PBGC is authorized to conduct periodic audits of multiemployer plans that receive SFA.

As of October 27, 2023, PBGC has approved about $53.5 billion in SFA to plans that cover over 771,000 workers, retirees, and beneficiaries.

The SFA Program operates under a final rule, published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2022, which became effective August 8, 2022, and was amended effective January 26, 2023.","The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) approved the application for the Local 210's Pension Plan in New York City to receive $49.3 million in Special Financial Assistance from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This will ensure that participants in the plan can continue to receive their full retirement benefits without reduction for many years into the future. The SFA Program will provide funding to severely underfunded multiemployer pension plans, protecting the retirement security of millions of Americans."

Many students want their professors to help alleviate their stress.

College students, as a group, are experiencing high levels of anxiety and depression, which is impacting their college experience and learning opportunities.

Many students believe their professors have some responsibility to help ease their stress and improve their mental health, according to a spring 2023 Student Voice survey by Inside Higher Ed and College Pulse. Nearly half of students with mental health conditions say their professors have a responsibility to help students who are struggling.

Survey respondents believe there are several ways professors can and should help with stress, including dropping the lowest assignment grade, avoiding high-stakes assignments and providing flexibility for students struggling with their mental health when appropriate.

One professor at the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences in Miami learned firsthand how meeting a struggling student where they are can create an impact on overall academic success and provide a new lens to identify success.

The snapshot: Caprice Quinones, an assistant professor of physical therapy, teaches a neuromuscular course for upper-level doctoral students at USAHS and delivers a competency practical exam.

On one testing day, Quinones explains, she walked into the testing room and found a student on the verge of panic, who immediately burst into tears when Quinones checked in on her.

The student was experiencing a crisis at home and doubting her academic ability, having failed a different practical the same week and struggling in other coursework. “She felt like a failure,” Quinones says. “She hadn’t even taken the practical yet, and she already felt like a failure.”

Quinones related to the student’s experiences, with mounting pressures to be a good sister and daughter on top of academic stressors, so she began to share her own story, an approach many professors have taken, especially since the pandemic.

“At that moment, I realized I was no longer her professor, but rather one human being listening to … another,” Quinones says. “It was a silver lining moment between us as I expressed that I too was not perfect.”

Quinones also provided the student with empathetic advice and referred her to seek other services on campus to support her mental and academic health.

Weeks later, the student returned to Quinones and shared that the conversation had transformed her life, and she was now equipped with newfound confidence and another perspective on life, simply from being heard and seen by an encouraging professor. The student’s academic performance improved, as did an interest in future mentorship of students like herself who needed a listening ear.

Lessons learned: As a professor, investing in the next generation of learners is one of Quinones’s driving motivations. “Looking back on this interaction I had with my student only showed me why I continue to do what I do every day,” she says.

Inspiring, instilling drive and inciting excitement among students remains a primary challenge for instructors, and Quinones believes it’s due to a fear of failure and a lack of confidence in overcoming failures.

“However, all studies on highly successful individuals agree that it is the way you cope with failure that shapes you, not the failure itself, which is why I advocate to my students that ‘If we learn from experience, there can be no such thing as failure,’” Quinones says.

At first, he was hesitant to come, but I was able to convince him that I was there to help him. During our meeting, he opened up about the challenges he was facing, including financial difficulties and family issues. I could tell he was struggling to balance his academic and personal life.I found ways to provide him with additional resources and support to help him succeed in the class. I also provided him with moral support and a listening ear. In the end, my student was able to turn his grades around and gain back his confidence. He thanked me for my help and said he was thankful for the opportunity to talk and get help. That moment was a reminder of why I love teaching and helping students reach their goals."
2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Fearful Maine residents stay home amid massive search for suspect in ...,https://news.yahoo.com/police-active-shooter-lewiston-maine-002430690.html,"LEWISTON, Maine (AP) — Shocked and fearful Maine residents kept to their homes for a second night Thursday as hundreds of heavily armed police and FBI agents searched intensely for Robert Card, an Army reservist authorities say fatally shot 18 people at a bowling alley and a bar in the worst mass killing in state history.

Much of Thursday’s search focused on a property belonging to one of Card’s relatives in rural Bowdoin, where trucks and vans full of armed agents from the FBI and other agencies eventually surrounded a home. Card and anyone else inside were repeatedly ordered to surrender.

“You need to come outside now with nothing in your hands. Your hands in the air,” police said through a loudspeaker. In most instances when police execute warrants — even for suspects wanted for violent crimes — they move quickly to enter the home.

But hours later, after repeated announcements and a search, authorities moved off — and it was still unclear whether Card had ever been at the location, state police said.

Richard Goddard, who lives on the road where the search took place, knows the Card family. Robert Card, who is four years younger, knows the terrain well, Goddard said.

“This is is his stomping ground. He grew up here,"" he said. “He knows every ledge to hide behind, every thicket.”

Several homes were being searched and every lead pursued in the hunt for Card, a 40-year-old with firearms instructor training. Authorities said he should be considered armed and dangerous and not approached.

Card is suspected of opening fire with at least one rifle at a bar and a bowling alley Wednesday in Lewiston, which is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from Bowdoin and is Maine’s second-largest city. The evening shootings killed 18 people and wounded 13 others, with three people still hospitalized in critical condition, authorities said.

Authorities haven’t said how many guns were used or how they were obtained.

Schools, doctor’s offices and grocery stores closed and people stayed behind locked doors in cities as far as 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the scenes of the shootings. Maine’s largest city, Portland, closed its public buildings, while Canada Border Services Agency issued an “armed and dangerous” alert to its officers stationed along the U.S. border.

April Stevens lives in the same neighborhood where one of the shootings took place. She turned on all her lights overnight and locked her doors. She knew someone killed at the bar and another person injured who needed surgery.

“We’re praying for everyone,” Stevens said through tears.

The attacks stunned a state of only 1.3 million people that has one of the country’s lowest homicide rates: 29 killings in all of 2022.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills promised to do whatever was needed to find Card and to “hold whoever is responsible for this atrocity accountable ... and to seek full justice for the victims and their families.”

As authorities searched for Card, details about his recent behavior emerged. Card underwent a mental health evaluation in mid-July after he began acting erratically while with his reserve regiment, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.

A bulletin sent to police across the country after the attack said Card had been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks this past summer after “hearing voices and threats to shoot up” a military base.

Maine doesn’t require permits to carry guns, and the state has a longstanding culture of gun ownership that is tied to its traditions of hunting and sport shooting. Keeping in mind the strong support for gun rights, lawmakers passed a “yellow flag” law in 2019 that would require police to seek a medical evaluation of anyone believed to be dangerous before then trying to take their guns away. However, critics charged that it was a weaker version of the tougher “red flag” laws that many other states have adopted.

A neighbor, Dave Letarte, said Card’s family let them deer hunt on their property and were kind, although Letarte said he noticed Card appeared to have mental problems for a while.

“People have problems, but you don’t expect them to go on the deep end like that,” Letarte said. “When we saw it on the news last night, I was shocked.”

A telephone number listed for Card in public records was not in service. A woman who answered a phone number for one of Card’s relatives said Thursday afternoon the family was helping the FBI. She didn’t give her name or additional details.

Eight murder warrants were issued for Card after authorities identified eight of the victims, police said. Ten more will likely be issued once the names of the rest of the dead are confirmed, said Maine State Police Col. William Ross.

Three of the 13 people wounded in the shootings were in critical condition and five were hospitalized but stable, Central Maine Medical Center officials said.

The attack started at Just-In-Time Recreation, where a children’s bowling league was taking place, just before 7 p.m. Wednesday.

Patrick Poulin was supposed to be at the bowling center with his 15-year-old son, who is in a league that was practicing Wednesday. They stayed home, but he estimates there were probably several dozen young bowlers, ages 4 to 18, along with their parents, in the facility. Poulin’s brother was there, he said, and shepherded some of the children outside when the shooting began.

“He’s pretty shook up,” Poulin said Thursday. “And it’s just sinking in today, like, wow, I was very close to being there. And a lot of the people that got hurt, I know.”

Less than 15 minutes later, numerous 911 calls started coming in from Schemengees Bar and Grille a few miles away.

The search for Card covered both land and water. The Coast Guard sent out a patrol boat Thursday morning along the Kennebec River, but after hours of searching, they found “nothing out of the ordinary,” said Chief Petty Officer Ryan Smith, who is in charge of the Coast Guard’s Boothbay Harbor Station.

A car believed to belong to Card had been discovered by a boat launch in the town of Lisbon near the Androscoggin River, which connects to the Kennebec, and Card’s 15-foot (4.5-meter) boat remains unaccounted for, Smith said.

In many past U.S. mass shootings, the suspect was found — whether dead or alive — within minutes. But Card was still on the loose a full day after the shootings.

Lewiston was mostly empty on an unusually warm fall day Thursday. Changeable message signs reminded people to stay behind locked doors.

In Bates College in Lewiston, students stayed in dorms with the blinds closed, said Diana Florence, whose son is a sophomore. She has a daughter who is a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was locked down twice last month for a shooting and a man with a gun.

“I could not believe it — that this is happening again. It’s happening to my son after it just happened to my daughter,” she said in a phone interview Thursday.

The shootings mark the 36th mass killing in the United States this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.

At a news conference, the Lewiston shootings prompted Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden in Maine to apologize for opposing a ban on assault weapons in the past. He urged Congress to pass such a law.

“I have opposed efforts to ban deadly weapons of war like the assault rifle used to carry out this crime,” he said. “The time has now come for me to take responsibility for this failure.”

This story has been corrected to show the name of the bowling alley is Just-In-Time Recreation, not Sparetime Recreation as authorities had called it.

Ninety-one bipartisan members of Congress have joined in objecting to a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed rule for minimum staffing levels at nursing homes.

U.S. Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind. and others, including Reps. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., Jared Golden, D-Maine and Chris Pappas, D-N.H., sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra saying the requirements would inevitably result in limited access to care for seniors, increases in the Medicaid budget and widespread nursing home closures.

""At a time when nursing homes are already experiencing healthcare worker shortages and financial hardships, CMS and the Biden Administration should not be implementing a regulation that would only exacerbate this issue,"" Pence said in the letter.

The regulation would result in a reduction of long-term care options, especially in rural communities, they said.

Guthrie suggested his bipartisan Building America's Health Care Workforce Act would bolster the workforce by extending a pathway for temporary nurse aides to become Certified Nursing Assistants.

The American Health Care Association, National Rural Health Association, National Association of State Veterans Homes, Lutheran Services in America, Council for Health and Human Services Ministries, and LeadingAge are supportive of the letter, according to Pence's office.

WHY THIS MATTERS

CMS issued the proposed rule on September 1 as a response to President Biden's 2022 State of the Union Address calling for Medicare to set higher standards for nursing homes.

A final rule is due out any time after the comment period closes on Monday, November 6.

The proposal has received pushback from long-term care facilities and others as all providers grapple with staffing shortages.

The American Hospital Association said if implemented, the rule would exacerbate current delays in moving patients from hospitals to nursing homes due to capacity issues. This could become especially dire in rural and underserved communities, the AHA said.

Under the CMS proposal, nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid would need to provide residents with a minimum of 0.55 hours of care from a registered nurse per resident per day, and 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aide per resident per day.

CMS estimates that about 75% of nursing homes would be required to bolster their staffing levels to comply with the regulations.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported there are roughly 235,900 fewer healthcare staff working in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities compared to March of 2020, according to information posted by Pappas. Under the rule, nursing homes would need to hire nearly 13,000 registered nurses and 76,000 nursing assistants, costing billions to implement.

Noncompliance with CMS' proposed minimum staffing requirements would lead to citations for noncompliance with Medicare Conditions of Participation, potentially resulting in a variety of enforcement actions, including imposition of Civil Monetary Penalties, denial of payments for new admissions, and even termination from the Medicare program, Pappas said.

THE LARGER TREND

Nursing homes came under scrutiny during the height of the pandemic when infections of residents represented an estimated 8% of COVID-19 cases nationwide. As of February 2022, 200,000 nursing home residents had died from COVID-19, according to KFF.

Kaiser Health News reported around the time of the September 1 proposed rule that CMS's own study, released in June, said no single staffing level would guarantee quality care.

Texas A&M has now taken two significant hits to their still-elite 2024 recruiting, first losing 2024 four-star wide receiver Drelon Miller. On Thursday night, it was reported by On3’s Hayes Fawcett that highly coveted 2024 five-star offensive tackle Weston Davis, who committed to the Aggies in June, has flipped his commitment to the LSU Tigers.

While the specifics of his decision are currently unknown, the Beaumont (TX) native was an overwhelming favorite to land with the Tigers before surprisingly announcing his initial commitment to Texas A&M, so from that narrow perspective, maybe this isn’t as surprising as it looks on the surface.

However, Aggies O-line coach Steve Adazzio has been an absolute disaster this season, and I do not doubt that this had some or even significant influence on Davis’ final decision.

After taking an official visit to LSU on June 23rd, just three days before committing to A&M, who knows how much influence head coach Brian Kelly could have had leading up to today’s news?

BREAKING: Five-Star OT Weston Davis tells me he has Flipped his Commitment from Texas A&M to LSU!

Again, I’m not going to sugarcoat this: this one stings. Losing one of the best offensive tackle prospects in the country has become an unwanted custom in College Station under Fisher, and unless the Aggies turn things around in the second half of the 2023 campaign, things could get worse.

According to On3, Davis is currently positioned as the 18th player in the class, the 3rd-ranked offensive tackle, and the 4th-ranked player in Texas, already in the thick of his 2023 senior season at Beaumont (TX).

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Lit & Luz Is a Bilingual Celebration of Books - Publishers Weekly,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/trade-shows-events/article/93610-lit-luz-is-a-bilingual-celebration-of-books.html,"The annual Lit & Luz Festival returned to Chicago the week of October 13–21, celebrating 10 years of bilingual programming and cultural exchange between writers, artists, and musicians from the United States and Mexico.

Thanks in part to the boom in Spanish-language and bilingual publishing and bookselling in the U.S., Lit & Luz has found a growing audience; this year’s festival, which featured talks and workshops with such authors as Alejandra Oliva, José Olivarez, and Isabel Zapata, drew nearly 900 attendees. Lit & Luz was unofficially born in 2012 as an event series tied to the literary magazine MAKE, which spotlighted authors from Mexico and Chicago, and in 2014, the festival took on its current form with a grant from the MacArthur Foundation. The aim of Lit & Luz is to be “a response to the lack of both translated and Spanish-language literature in the U.S.,” said founder and managing director Sarah Dodson. The festival is currently produced by MAKE Literary Productions, of which Dodson is also executive director.

“When we first launched, the role of the translator in literature was under-recognized,” Dodson said, but she’s seen a gradual shift as “publishers, readers, authors, and even awarding institutions are, thanks in big part to the advocacy of translators themselves, recognizing the contributions of translators and the impact of translated texts—not to mention the public’s interest in them.” But Daniel Borzutzky, the festival’s founding artistic director, thinks there is still a way to go. “As a translator, I see a lot of rhetoric that supports translation and what it ‘represents,’ ” he said, “but I see very little material support in terms of finances for presses and translators to bring out new writing from other languages.”

Venezuelan poet and translator Adalber Salas Hernández, who participated in this year’s festival, agreed. “The publishing world in the U.S. is notably refractory to translated works—its monolingualism is pervasive,” he said. “Latinx presence in it, however tenuous, is creating possibilities for change.”

One change has been the proliferation of bilingual books. Borzutzky, who is also a National Book Award–winning poet, has noticed an uptick in bilingual collections by U.S.-born Latinx poets, with the English original and a Spanish translation appearing side by side. He noted that two such collections from this year—Promises de Oro by José Olivarez, translated by David Ruano, and The Border Simulator by Gabriel Dozal, translated by Natasha Tiniacos—were “published by major publishers” (Holt and One World, respectively).

Borzutzky stressed that small presses such as Action Books, Co-im-Press, and Eulalia have largely led the charge to bring translations of “experimental and lesser-known poets from Latin America” to the U.S. “There should be greater support for this kind of courageous publishing,” he said. Most Hispanophone authors at this year’s festival are published in the U.S. by small publishers such as Coffee House and Kenning Editions.

As for Spanish-language bookselling, Dodson has seen improvement since launching Lit & Luz. “In the beginning, it was very challenging to get Spanish-language books from participating authors into partner bookstores—not for lack of interest, but from very few distribution opportunities in the U.S. for Spanish-language titles,” she said. In the early years of the festival, most authors participating in the festival had to bring copies of their own books from Mexico, she added. “That has since changed.”

Colombian-born, Chicago-based author Juan Martinez, who participated in this year’s festival, is especially glad to see more bilingual books in publishers’ catalogs and on store shelves. “It’s exciting to feel like there’s a real market for these books—because of course there is,” he said. Martinez also thinks that in recent years “the jump in visibility and representation is dramatic” for Latinx authors and books more generally, he said—“but only because it had been so barren just a moment ago.”

“I’d very much like for representation to at least mirror the same rough demographic we’re in,” he said. The U.S. is roughly 19% Latinx, but in a recent report by Penguin Random House, the publisher found that in 2020 Latinx individuals accounted for just 9% of its workforce and 5% of its authors, illustrators, and translators. “It’d be nice to see those figures match up,” Martinez said.

For Lit & Luz, spotlighting Latin American writing and writers to the U.S. is a crucial first step toward creating industry-level change. Dodson stressed that Mexican literature in particular is neglected in the States, even though people of Mexican origin make up nearly 60% of the Latinx population. “Mexican literature should be part of all reading lists in the U.S., but even in translation, contemporary Mexican authors are too often overlooked,” Dodson said. “Lit & Luz would like to see Mexican authors’ titles included—in bookstores, in U.S. literary festivals, in homework assignments, and in people’s homes.”"," has been incredible.”The 10th annual Lit & Luz Festival celebrated bilingual programming, cultural exchange, and Spanish-language and bilingual publishing and bookselling in the U.S. Nearly 900 attendees enjoyed talks and workshops by authors from Mexico and the U.S. Small presses have led the charge to bring translations of experimental Latin American authors to the U.S., with major publishers increasingly producing bilingual books. Lit & Luz seeks to respond to the lack of Spanish-language literature in the U.S. and has seen a shift in recognition and support for translators and translated texts in the publishing world."

Rep. Jared Golden, a Marine Corps veteran who lives in Lewiston, Maine, said Thursday that in light of the recent mass shooting in his hometown he was changing his view on banning assault-style weapons.

""Humility is called for as accountability is sought by victims of a tragedy such as this one,"" Golden said at a news conference alongside other officials.

Arguably the most conservative Democrat in the House, Golden said that ""I have opposed efforts to ban deadly weapons of war like the assault rifle used to carry out this crime.""

Democrats and Republicans have largely been divided about gun violence, with Democrats urging restrictions on firearms to curb frequent shootings in America while GOP lawmakers often argue such regulations are unconstitutional and ineffective compared with focusing on mental health or on increasing security.

At Thursday's press conference alongside Golden, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said that she supported some measures like a ban on high-volume ammunition magazines but did not back an assault rifle ban.

The latest numbers from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system show that deposits in all US commercial banks suffered a $100 billion decline in three weeks – from $17.38 trillion on September 27th down to $17.28 trillion on October 18th.

The deposit flight comes amid a new survey from the Federal Reserve that polls 25 participants, including market professionals, academics, investment funds and research and advisory firms.

The participants say that while the sector may have withstood financial tremors early this year, banks are still at risk of another crisis for two key reasons.

“Although survey respondents noted the banking sector has stabilized since the period of acute stress earlier this year, many highlighted risks of renewed deposit outflows given that large portions of deposits remain uninsured.

Many respondents continued to link risks of re-emerging banking-sector stress to potential losses on CRE (commercial real estate) exposures, particularly among smaller and regional banks.”

Participants also view the commercial real sector as a “potential trigger for systemic stress” amid higher interest rates and declining demand for office space due to the shift to a hybrid work environment.

“Survey respondents viewed small and regional domestic banks as particularly vulnerable due to their higher concentration of CRE exposures, which could lead to tighter bank lending conditions.”

Traffic was light in Blue Ash at Cooper and Kenwood Roads early in the morning. The area is under a winter storm warning until mid-day Tuesday. Some places could see up to 12 inches of snow. And the temperatures will remain below freezing.

In 2008, Cincinnati voters passed a charter amendment restricting the use of red-light cameras. The amendment declared the city ""shall not use any traffic law photo-monitoring device for the enforcement of a qualified traffic law violation, unless a law enforcement officer is present at the location of the device and personally issues the ticket.""

Councilman Jeff Cramerding has suggested undoing the ban, saying voters he has talked to are considered about drivers violating traffic laws.

We asked city council candidates about their thoughts on repealing the traffic enforcement camera ban. Here's what they said.

Anna Albi

""While we absolutely need to continue to prioritize pedestrian safety, I would want to ensure that the placement of the cameras would not disproportionately target any community. I’d also like more information regarding how ticketing would work given current state law. ""

Jeff Cramerding

""Yes, traffic enforcement and public safety are real priorities. This ban also should not be in the city's charter.""

Mark Jeffreys

""Yes, but there is a but. We need to do this the right way. There are stakeholders that are concerned rightfully given the history of red light cameras that it will not be implemented equitably - that it will impact communities of color more. We need to develop what the plan would be before putting forth a repeal. I'm in favor of starting with a plan to implement them in school zones where we can recoup some of the investment in them, but knowing ahead of time where they will go, how we are going to manage the camera footage, etc. That is a thoughtful, methodical approach to this. That's needed given the history of how these have been used in the past.""

Scotty Johnson

""No, I do not support red light cameras.""

Jan-Michele Lemon Kearney

""We have not had enough discussion, community input, and research on pros and cons before deciding whether torepeal our Charter’s ban on red light cameras,"" said Kearney, calling herself a ""no,"" on repealing the ban.

Liz Keating

""A red light camera ban does not belong in the city’s charter ... I believe we need to remove the ban from the city’s charter and then begin constructive dialogue to determine if and how to implement the red light cameras to promote safety in all 52 neighborhoods.""

After a brief back and forth, Musk supposedly said: “Well, Bill, maybe it’s time you faced some real challenges. How about a stint in jail? I think orange would look great on you.”

The article began:

Elon Musk: “It’s Time To Put Bill Gates In Prison” In an unexpected twist in the billionaire saga that has captivated audiences for years, Elon Musk, the audacious CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently made headlines by suggesting that tech magnate Bill Gates deserves some time behind bars. Was it over monopolizing the personal computer market? Or perhaps due to a disagreement on whose rockets are fancier? Well, as the details unfold, it’s evident that the stakes have never been this humorous.

While Gates and Musk have crossed paths in the past, after first meeting in March 2022, this interaction never happened and the details of the article are not a factual recounting of real-life events.

By Jaheim T. Tumu

The project, which was coined “Delivering Peace Dividends in Liberia: “Consolidating Local Reconciliation and Social Cohesion Opportunities in Grand Gedeh and Sinoe Counties” brought over forty (40) participants that includes counties’ Leaders, project stakeholders, beneficiaries, disadvantaged groups, representatives from commercial motorcyclists, farmers, the Muslim community, foreign residents market women, youth, women and other religious leaders.

Accordingly, phase two of the project was designed to build on the gains of phase one with the aim of enhancing the capacity of beneficiaries thereby building their skills in project proposal development as well as working with them to develop and submit proposals for their identified projects.

It would further collaborate with local to implement, identified social-economic and livelihood in Grand Gedeh and Sinoe Counties. Furthermore, to promote peace and social cohesion in a sustained manner through the development and implementation of projects that deliver tangible peace dividends to the people.

During the opening sessions, it was said that information sharing on phase two of the project would be rolled out and explained the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in the implementation as well as to gauge the perspectives of key stakeholders, especially women and youth whose participation were important for the successful implementation of the different stages of the project.

The session also ensure the team to identify potential local services providers, resource individuals and to have an initial appreciation of potential beneficiaries understanding of project development, proposal writing and project implementation..

Delivering his welcome remarks, a proxy of the County Inspector of Grand Gedeh, Mr. Ebenezer P. Tiah lauded P4DP and partners for the second phase of the project and recounted how P4DP’s peace efforts have contributed to resolving conflict and also minimizing potential conflict in county.

Mr. Tiah stated that the initiative has assisted women from several communities especially Tchien and Gbarzon District who have organized a Peace Mother Club to settle through dialogues and providing social and economic support to each other.

He emphasized that the county needs more of these interventions during the second phase, given the testimonies we have heard from members of the women group as well as what he had heard on the radio.

Said Tiah, “I have followed Niao Tordee women activities on Smile FM which in my opinion impacted not only the women but the whole county because they provided awareness and enlightenment on how to address some of the common causes of conflict at the level of households, the communities and even at the level of the districts”.

Delivering the overview of the project, Mr. Kennedy K. Berrian, the project officer of P4DP, emphasized that the peaceful dividend nature of project as the main objective of phase two.

According to him, the project will ensure stakeholders support women and youth led initiatives that will have a trigger down impact on the society as a mean to address some of those issues mentioned initially in phase one.

He further emphasized though it is important that they build on the gains made in phase one but there is a need to improve and address those issues that will primarily focus on a peace dividend objective rather than targeting projects that will provide benefits for few groups.

Mr. Berrian said, “Although these interventions will be done through the peace mother clubs and the youth peace and learning centers but this doesn’t mean the projects will just benefit women and youth, so we need to think about how everyone in the communities and districts can benefit from these projects.”

Speaking after the overview, Elder Chelsie Mennoh, Chairperson of the Sinoe County Citizen Action committee, applauded the facilitators for the continued use of dialogue as the means to communicate and gather information about the project activities.

”We should not forget about how the ‘under the kola tree dialogues’ brought us together and help us to find solutions to some of the issues, so let us continue using dialogue method in this phase two, he said.

The Chairperson of the Grand Gedeh Citizen Action Committee, Madam Amelia W. Karr emphasized that the peace dividend projects should seek to address issues beyond the few selected groups interest.

She further stated that the project should strive to incorporate ideas and thoughts of diverse groups.

“I will suggest that the project be designed in such a way that everyone will benefit since it is about peace dividend, let collect ideas from everyone, she said.

Following the closure of the overview, participants emphasized on the use of existing community structures in channeling communications and networking to the larger populations.

They recommended the coordination of the project stakeholders to ensure an efficient and coordinated approach during project implementation.

They, therefore, highlighted the importance of the County Focal points to regularly attend and follow up their meetings especially in a way that will ensure they frequently exchange information and get technical support in the implementation.

However, there were also concerns about the misuse of the media by young people in propagating the agenda of their political Aspirants and parties.

Participants at both Greenville and Zwedru sessions, asserted that the youth at times throw insults and use inappropriate languages while on their media propaganda.

According to the participants, those behaviors have the propensity of inciting and instilling violence among the youthful followers of the politicians who are mostly commercial motorcyclists.

They indicated that, in order to address these concerns, there have been calls for the Citizens Action Committee in Greenville to work with Leaders of commercial motorcyclists to take some measures that will curtail the inappropriate use of the media space by politicians and their supporters."," the support of the local partners of P4DP in Grand Gedeh and Sinoe counties, funding is only available for Grand Gedeh county and so they are working with Sinoe County to identify other funding sources”.The Platform for Dialogue and Peace (P4DP) and the UN Peacebuilding Fund have completed plans and a timeline for an evaluation of phase two of their project to provide peace dividends, reconciliation and social cohesion in Grand Gedeh and Sinoe Counties.

However, its adoption across online platforms and organizations has received mixed reactions. Several users have raised concerns about the privacy policies and guardrails put in place to ensure that the technology doesn't spiral out of control.

Earlier this year, Microsoft released its Work Index Report, which was mainly centered around AI and how it impacts productivity in the workplace. Of the 31,000 polled participants across 31 countries, only 49% highlighted that they were concerned about AI taking over their jobs, while 70% of the employees were ready to adopt the technology and incorporate it into their workflow. They stated that they would use the technology to handle mundane tasks, which would lessen their workload.

As users and organizations continue to embrace the technology, now more than ever, it's apparent that it will play a major role in the workplace. The paradigm shift is already on course. Recently, Apple advertised a few open positions within the company, and some of the key qualities and skills it was looking for were AI-focused. This is an indicator that recruiters and organizations have clocked the potential of the technology and are now looking to seize the opportunity to boost profitability and efficiency.

Unlike Microsoft, Apple has remained quiet on the generative AI front and has only made subtle moves. Perhaps an indicator that it is playing safe and doesn't want to jump the gun before elaborate measures and guardrails are in place to ensure that any setbacks by the technology can be mitigated in a timely manner.

ChatGPT expertise is a major selling point for job seekers

As the economy continues to take a major hit, many businesses and organizations struggle to keep operations running, which is why layoffs are at an all-time high. Microsoft, in particular, has been on the receiving end, having announced that it intends to cut 10,000 jobs before the end of FY23 Q3.

This makes it even harder to land a job, but according to a Resume Builder survey, 90% out of 1,000 U.S. business leaders indicated that while recruiting for a new position within their organizations, they mostly look out for job applicants with versatile ChatGPT skill sets. According to recruiters, this greatly impacts the job applicant's chances of eventually landing the job post, as spotted by CNBC.

The Resume Builder survey further disclosed that 49% of the organizations that took part in the exercise have already incorporated ChatGPT into their workflow. The chatbot is mainly used to curate content, write code, summarize meetings, and more.

According to Andrew Higashi, CEO of ChangeEngine:

""Candidates who are familiar with and comfortable using the latest technological tools, including ChatGPT, will always have a competitive advantage in the job market.""

With the ever-emerging trends, the conventional skills and a degree from campus no longer cut it. Organizations and recruiters are actively looking for employees with diverse and ""up-to-date"" skill sets. And whether you like it or not, AI is making it to that list rapidly.

So, where can you work with these diverse sets of skills? Right off the bat, you can easily land a job in the copywriting and social media management industry. Of course, originality and authenticity remain a top priority, The AI tools are just in place to spark creativity and reduce the workload by helping you get through mundane tasks quickly. There's also a space for you as a technical AI engineer or even in marketing.

As Business Insider reports, most of these jobs aren't technical, which means you don't have to be deeply rooted in engineering or coding to land a job. What's more, these are well-paying jobs, which could see you earn as much as $335,000 (certainly close to what new hires at Microsoft make).

Open positions popping up on job sites like ZipRecruiter are now looking for employees who are willing to learn and leverage new technologies and platforms such as TikTok and ChatGPT to tap into new areas and access new communities.

Recruiters are looking for more than just listing ChatGPT as a skill in your resume, they need a detailed account citing some of the accomplishments and feats you've been able to achieve while leveraging the tool's capabilities.

(PHOTO: Lester Nyan)

SINGAPORE — Seven Build-To-Order (BTO), two Sale of Balance Flats (SBF), and two Open Booking of Flats (OBF) attempts – that's what it took for research writer Lester Nyan and his fiancee to secure a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat.

It was a ""huge sigh of relief"" for the couple who are hoping to settle down and start a family.

After multiple attempts, Nyan, 28, and his fiancee Cheryl Chua, 24, finally got a four-room flat in a central location for S$560,000.

""Since we're going to get married soon, housing is definitely a big concern for us. Having something ready for us in the pipeline is a very huge relief,"" Nyan told Yahoo Finance Singapore. Nyan and Chua had gotten engaged in June 2023 and plan to marry in March 2024.

Nyan felt fortunate that they had secured the unit in the early part of the year, as he was already planning to propose to Chua in June. Although the proposal would have gone through regardless, he says that their marriage plans would be delayed if they had yet to secure a BTO flat.

Not having a BTO flat would also mean having to rent from the open market, which is markedly higher than if they were to rent under HDB's subsidised Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS), a temporary housing option for first-timer married couples awaiting completion of their BTO flat.

Both Nyan and Chua grew up in big households, and space was an issue as they had to share a room with their siblings. As a result, the couple were determined to have their own space as soon as possible, even if it meant renting an apartment before their flat's completion. Given that the estimated completion date of their flat is slated for the second quarter of 2028 – five years from now – Nyan said that they plan to rent under the PPHS. This would involve another round of balloting.

Story continues

Challenging journey to secure a BTO flat

The couple's first attempt at securing a unit was in August 2020, and they have consistently applied since but to no avail. This included applying for a flat in Yishun, which is categorised as a non-mature estate, which would allow them to have a higher chance of securing a unit. On the other hand, buying an HDB flat from the resale market was out of the question as it was beyond their budget.

""One of the biggest factors was definitely because we both just started working. Our income didn't allow us to go for a resale, which required a higher loan. This was why we kept trying for a BTO because we have a longer runway to increase our income along the way,"" said Nyan, who works as a research writer while Chua works as a social media producer.

For the eager couple who were very sure of their shared goals to build a life together, the numerous failed attempts to secure a flat took an emotional toll.

""For every application, we really envisioned ourselves staying in that estate. Every time we applied, we would be very excited. We'd go look at floor plans and plan our layout. So, every time we got the results back and we didn't get it, we felt very heartbroken.

""In one of the applications, I remember both of us felt really defeated after we didn't get the queue number, and tears were definitely shed,"" Nyan recalled.

Learning from the BTO process

Nevertheless, Nyan and Chua were elated with the unit that they eventually secured. According to Nyan, it was the most desirable location that they've bid for out of all their BTO attempts. Reflecting on their journey, Nyan said that he believes their chances of securing a flat became significantly lower because they kept trying for a five-room flat in mature estates, which typically has the highest demand but fewer available units.

""From the start, if we were to go for the less subscribed areas or non-mature estates, we might have gotten it earlier,"" said Nyan in hindsight.

""I think a lot of people in my shoes would have gone for a resale, but the reason why we persevered with the process was because it made the most sense to us in terms of our current situation. I would always tell friends around me that every couple is different. You really have to fully understand your current capabilities and current circumstances in order to make an informed decision,"" Nyan advised.

Every time we applied, we would be very excited. We'd go look at floor plans and plan our layout. So, every time we got the results back and we didn't get it, we felt very heartbroken.Lester Nyan

To other young couples who are going through the BTO process or are thinking of it, Nyan cautioned against making a huge financial commitment together if they are not certain of their relationship.

""When many people first start dating, they would already be thinking about whether they should start applying (for a BTO unit) since it takes such a long time to get the flat. But if the relationship is not stable, I foresee a lot of stress, and a lot of fights and arguments will come up along the way,"" he said.

Nyan shared that he and Chua had many conversations about whether they saw themselves spending the rest of their lives together before applying for a BTO within the first year of their relationship. They have been together for close to four years now.

""If you get a BTO unit and you pay the downpayment before you are certain about your relationship, it may be a big financial mistake,"" said Nyan.

It takes a village to put on ESPN’s “College GameDay” every week.

In addition to the large number of ESPN employees that are building the “College GameDay” set at Presidents Circle on the campus of the University of Utah, which began Thursday, an estimated 80 to 90 people from the university side are also involved in making sure everything runs as smoothly as possible this weekend.

“We’ve got a large contingent of university leadership, athletics leadership, and then several departments anywhere from the fire marshal to security to public safety to catering. The list goes on and on and on and on,” said Gavin Gough, the university’s associate athletics director for facilities, operations and capital projects.

On a tight schedule akin to the setup and teardown that happens at big arena and stadium concerts, a horde of trucks rolled into Salt Lake City on Thursday, and the crew began constructing the main stage, setting up giant TV screens, speakers and crowd barricades, among other things.

Before former Indianapolis Colts punter turned media personality Pat McAfee and his co-hosts take the stage at 10 a.m. MDT Friday morning for “The Pat McAfee Show,” live from the University of Utah, everything will be ready to roll, about 24 hours from when they first started setting things up.

The University of Utah officially found out that “College GameDay” would be coming to Salt Lake City at the same time everyone else did Sunday morning. Though U. administrators didn’t know for certain before that moment, ESPN did send them a prep letter several weeks in advance of the Utah-Oregon matchup to notify the school that they may be a candidate to host “College GameDay.”

“There’s a lot of factors that go into what sort of leans us or allows us to start thinking about it seriously and actually mobilize and start some of our planning,” Gough said. “But for this last week, we had an idea that it could happen if we were fortunate to win the game, which we were, and it was very exciting.”

After Utah took down USC on the road and Oregon took care of business against Washington State, it set up a top-15 clash between the No. 13 Utes and No. 8 Ducks. Each team has one loss, and the loser could be knocked out of Pac-12 title contention on Saturday.

The matchup is one of just two this weekend featuring two top-25 teams, the other being No. 18 Louisville vs. No. 20 Duke, so it was an obvious choice for “College GameDay.”

‘Block out the noise’

Saturday’s broadcast will be the fifth time the traveling pregame show has originated from Utah’s campus (2004: No. 5 Utah 52, BYU 21; 2010: No. 3 TCU 47, No. 5 Utah 7; 2015: No. 5 Utah 30, No. 23 Cal 24; 2016: No. 4 Washington 31, No. 17 Utah 24.)

Utah coach Kyle Whittingham has been through the process before, three times as a head coach and once as a defensive coordinator.

He acknowledged that he and some players will be doing some extra media — Whittingham will appear on “The Pat McAfee Show” Friday at 12:30 p.m. MDT and “College GameDay” on Saturday at 8 a.m. MDT — but will try to keep his players in as normal of a routine as possible and try to have the players “block out the noise.”

“It’s great for the team as far as knowing that, hey, we’re the center of the college football universe this week, I guess,” Whittingham said. “And it’s a positive thing for them, and a reward of sorts, I guess you could say. For the community, it’s awesome, the university. It brings exposure to our brand and just the university and community in general. So I think it’s a win all across the board.”

Running back Ja’Quinden Jackson took Whittingham’s words to heart.

“We’re really not really focused on it. We really focused on one objective and that’s to come out with a ‘W,’” Jackson said, later saying that he wants “GameDay” viewers to know how tough and creative Utah is.

Tight end Landen King, who caught his second touchdown of the season against USC, sees “GameDay,” and playing Oregon, as a “full-circle” moment.

“I grew up watching ‘College GameDay,’ watching Oregon. De’Anthony Thomas, he was really one of my favorite players. So it’s really cool how everything’s coming full circle in life. So I’m really just appreciating every moment,” King said.

‘A three-hour commercial for our university’

The first two times the show came to town, it was broadcast live outside the main parking lot at Rice-Eccles Stadium, with the exterior of the venue providing the backdrop.

When “GameDay” came back five years later, the location was moved to Presidents Circle, with the backdrop the 109-year-old John R. Park Building. By now, college football viewers are familiar with Rice-Eccles Stadium, so the university wanted to put a spotlight on its campus.

“We identified President Circle as a really great opportunity and have loved it being there now two times and would be three times with this one,” Gough said.

“A lot of green space, a lot of open space, beautiful backdrop, centralized to campus, and what better area to highlight than that area of campus? This is a three-hour commercial for our university, and it’s a great spot for a lot of reasons, but it’s definitely picturesque.”

This season, “College GameDay” has attracted an average of 2 million viewers per show, That’s a lot of eyeballs on the University of Utah.

“It’s such a tremendous opportunity to showcase the excellence of this university as well as the athletics department and the football program. All of that is what is on display. And that’s really exciting, I think for not only all of us, but all of our fans,” said Paul Kirk, the senior associate athletics director for strategic communications at Utah.

The goal for Gough and his team is to make it as easy as possible for ESPN to do its thing this weekend. It helps that Utah’s hosted four “GameDays” (Gough assisted with the 2015 and 2016 shows), so the university knows the drill.

“It’s not as simple as them just showing up and parking and setting up the stage. There’s a lot that goes into the logistics ... Especially for this ESPN ‘College GameDay,’ this is a big-time deal, and we want them to remember how smooth it was for them and how friendly people were and how great it was to be on the University of Utah’s campus,” Gough said.

How to watch and attend “College GameDay,” and what Utah has planned

The festivities at the university start Friday at 10 a.m. MDT, when fans can attend the live broadcast of “The Pat McAfee Show,” which will be live from Presidents Circle until 1 p.m. MDT, followed by “College Football Live” from 1:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. MDT.

The guest picker has not been announced for “College GameDay,” but Ty Burrell and Lil Nas X will make appearances on the show. Features on quarterback Bryson Barnes and Whittingham will air during “GameDay.”

The university encourages all fans to arrive early to the set on Saturday morning, and University of Utah students can start camping out for “College GameDay” at 6 p.m. Friday night.

“College GameDay” begins its three-hour broadcast from Presidents Circle at 7 a.m. MDT, which can be watched on ESPN, with live “SportsCenter” spots starting at 5:45 a.m. MDT.

With “GameDay” ending at 10 a.m. and the Utah-Oregon game starting at 1:30 p.m., Gough’s hope is that fans stick around campus and then arrive at the stadium early.

Most Utah fans want to forget about the 2010 TCU game, a 47-7 Horned Frogs victory, but one memory that sticks out from that contest was that the stadium was packed well before kickoff as fans stayed on campus after “GameDay” and filed into Rice-Eccles Stadium early for the afternoon kickoff.

“‘GameDay’ will be no longer live at 10 o’clock, but there’ll still be a lot of (sponsor) activations going on. There’s a lot of sponsorships, so there’s a lot that will still be going on after 10 a.m. and then our plan is to move that crowd back to the tailgate area,” Gough said.

“We’ve got a lot of really strong traditions over there on Guardsman Way with all the pregame festivities that we do. The timing works really nicely for getting people back to the tailgate over to the stadium to welcome the team (at 11:15 a.m.) and continue the party that it’s going to be on Saturday.”

The show will run for two days and involve 80-90 people from the university to help ensure everything runs smoothly. The show will feature a matchup between the No. 13 Utes and No. 8 Ducks, two top-25 teams, with the loser likely being knocked out of Pac-12 title contention."

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Lowering energy bills for Canadians across the country,https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2023/10/lowering-energy-bills-for-canadians-across-the-country.html,"On October 26, 2023, the Prime Minister announced a series of new measures to lower energy bills for Canadians, and to provide more time and new support to help Canadians to transition to cleaner, more affordable home heating options. These measures include:

Temporarily pausing the fuel charge on deliveries of heating oil in all provinces and territories where it currently applies, effective November 9, 2023;

in all provinces and territories where it currently applies, effective November 9, 2023; Doubling the rural top-up for pollution pricing rebates (Climate Action Incentive payments) from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, with increased payments to rural residents starting in April 2024;

(Climate Action Incentive payments) from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, with increased payments to rural residents starting in April 2024; Making the average heat pump free for low- to median-income Canadians in provinces and territories that have agreed to support the delivery of enhanced federal heat pump grants; and,

for low- to median-income Canadians in provinces and territories that have agreed to support the delivery of enhanced federal heat pump grants; and, Incentivizing the switch to heat pumps with $250 upfront payments for low- to median-income Canadians.

Pausing the Fuel Charge on Deliveries of Heating Oil

In order to provide more time and financial support for the roughly 1.1 million homes in Canada using home heating oil, to switch to heat pumps, the government announced that it proposes to temporarily pause the application of the fuel charge on deliveries of heating oil, in all jurisdictions where it currently applies, for a three-year period.

Heating oil costs and usage vary according to household size, the severity of cold weather, and whether a home is exclusively heated by oil or through a dual system. On average in Canada, a home that heats with oil will use 1,350 litres over a heating season. In Atlantic Canada, the average consumption can be up to 1,500 litres. Oil-heated homes in Canada can expect to spend $2,100 to $3,000 per year on heating fuel, not including the cost of the fuel charge on light fuel oil used for heating.

The federal government’s fuel charge pause will save the average Atlantic Canadian household, using 1,500 litres of home heating oil, about $261 this year.

Under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA), a registered distributor generally pays the fuel charge upon delivery to another person that is not a registered distributor. For 2023-24, the fuel charge applies to light fuel oil at a rate of $0.1738 per litre.

To implement the pause, the government intends that the fuel charge would not be payable by registered distributors on light fuel oil that is delivered exclusively for use in providing heat to a home, building or similar structure. This relief is currently proposed to apply in all provinces where the fuel charge applies until the end of 2026-27. The exemption will apply upfront without the need for an exemption certificate.

Specifically, it is proposed that no fuel charge be payable in respect of light fuel oil that is delivered by a registered distributor in respect of light fuel oil to a person if:

the light fuel oil is for use exclusively in eligible heating activities;

the person receiving delivery is not a registered distributor in respect of light fuel oil; and,

the fuel is delivered on or after November 9, 2023, and before April 1, 2027.

Eligible heating activities are proposed to mean the use of light fuel oil exclusively for providing heat to a home, building or similar structure, but not for generating heat in an industrial process, such as processes that involve removing moisture from goods.

It is also proposed that registration rules for registered distributors be expanded to include a person that carries on the business of selling, delivering, or distributing light fuel oil and, in the ordinary course of that business, delivers in a listed province light fuel oil that is for use in eligible heating activities.

Other rules, in line with existing provisions in the GGPPA, are also proposed to ensure that the temporary removal of the fuel charge applies in the manner intended. These proposed rules would include diversion charges for exempt light fuel oil that is subsequently used in a manner otherwise than in eligible heating activities or delivered to another person. These proposed rules would also include provisions to ensure that light fuel oil, which is held by a person on an adjustment day that is on or before April 1, 2027, is not subject to an inventory charge if the fuel is held by the person for use exclusively in eligible heating activities. Complete draft regulatory proposals will be posted on the Department of Finance website in the coming days.

Doubling the Rural Top-Up for Pollution Pricing Rebates

To provide increased support for Canadians in rural and small communities, the government also announced it intends to double the rural top-up rate (also known as the rural supplement) for pollution pricing rebates (Climate Action Incentive payments) from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, in recognition of rural Canadians’ increased energy needs and limited access to clean transportation. Rural residents will receive their first increased payment starting in April 2024 and the increase will apply in all years going forward.

All direct proceeds from the federal fuel charge are returned to the jurisdiction in which they were collected. For those provinces that do not meet the federal stringency requirements in 2023-24 — Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador—the majority of proceeds from the federal fuel charge are returned to residents of those provinces through pollution pricing rebates.

To be eligible for the rural top-up, an individual must reside outside a Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) based on the most recent Census published by Statistics Canada before the taxation year.

To ensure that all those who are residing in a community that has previously been eligible for the rural top-up remain eligible going forward, the government also intends to continue using the CMA determinations based on the 2016 Census for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 fiscal years.

Making Heat Pumps Free by Strengthening the Oil to Heat Pump Affordability Program

Nearly 30 per cent of households in Atlantic Canada currently use home heating oil, compared to just 8 per cent in the rest of Canada. This means Atlantic Canada accounts for almost 25 per cent of all Canadian homes heated with oil, despite the region being home to only 6 per cent of the total Canadian population.

That is why the government announced that new supports to cover the cost of the average heat pump installation will begin rolling out in Atlantic Canadian provinces that have agreed to joint federal-provincial delivery of Oil to Heat Pump Affordability programs, with potential to expand to other provinces and territories that agree to support the delivery of the enhanced federal program. This support will help households with low- to median-incomes move away from heating oil and switch to an electric heat pump to heat, and also cool, their homes by:

Making the average heat pump free for at or below median-income households by increasing Oil to Heat Pump Affordability grants up to $15,000, from the current maximum of $10,000. The additional $5,000 for homeowners who install a heat pump will match provincial and territorial contributions via co-delivery programs.

for at or below median-income households by increasing Oil to Heat Pump Affordability grants up to $15,000, from the current maximum of $10,000. The additional $5,000 for homeowners who install a heat pump will match provincial and territorial contributions via co-delivery programs. Upfront payments of $250 for at or below median-income households that use heating oil and sign up to switch to a heat pump through a joint federal-provincial government program.

By covering the average cost for households to switch from heating oil to heat pumps, it is now free for those who need it most to benefit from more affordable, cleaner heating options that will save Canadians money on their energy bills for years to come. The federal government will continue working with all provinces and territories to explore further options to lower the cost of energy bills for all Canadians, while also lowering emissions and fighting climate change.","The Prime Minister announced a series of measures to lower energy bills and help Canadians transition to cleaner, more affordable home heating options. This includes temporarily suspending the fuel charge on heating oil deliveries, doubling the rural top-up for pollution pricing rebates, making the average heat pump free for low- to median-income Canadians and incentivizing the switch to heat pumps with $250 upfront payments.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Grit and Commitment Gets the Cayman Islands Off the FATF List,https://www.mfs.ky/news/media-release/grit-and-commitment-gets-the-cayman-islands-off-the-fatf-list/,"Grand Cayman, 27 October 2023 – The Cayman Islands – after two years of sustained hard work and engagement, both locally and internationally – is embracing today’s Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) decision to remove us from its anti-money laundering “grey list,” as FATF has determined that our AML regime now meets the global standard.

Minister of Financial Services and Commerce, the Hon. André Ebanks, said he’s barely able to contain his joy over what the public and private sectors, working together, have achieved since the FATF grey listing in 2021. That was when the Cayman Islands was given three action points to satisfy, in order to be deemed FATF compliant.

“Team Cayman faced this challenge with faith, competence and dedication,” he said. “We had a shared determination to step out from under this shadow as soon as possible and today, we have done exactly that.”

FATF announced the decision to delist the Cayman Islands following its 25-27 October plenary in Paris, which Minister Ebanks and the Attorney General, the Hon. Samuel Bulgin, KC, attended. Mr Bulgin chairs the Anti-Money Laundering Steering Group, which oversees AML for the Cayman Islands.

“The importance of this achievement simply cannot not be understated,” Mr Bulgin said. “FATF’s decision confirms that our AML regime effectively deters, detects, arrests and prosecutes financial crimes in the Cayman Islands, and that it also supports other countries’ efforts.”

Expanding on Mr Bulgin’s point, Minister Ebanks explained how AML effectiveness benefits everyone, locally and globally.

“Compliance with the FATF standard helps protect all of us as we conduct everyday business, whether that’s banking, purchasing local goods, or donating to charities,” he said.

FATF’s decision to delist the Cayman Islands completes our participation in FATF’s 4th-round mutual evaluation process. FATF will commence its 5th round process in 2025, with our evaluation expected to begin in 2026.

In preparation, Mr Bulgin said that we are monitoring and anticipating changes to the FATF standard, to ensure that our policies and legislation align; and monitoring changes to the FATF evaluation methodology, to assess how best to demonstrate the Cayman Islands’ effectiveness in implementing the standard.

Both the Attorney General and Minister Ebanks agreed that lessons learned during FATF’s 4th round are guiding preparations for the 5th round.

“Yes, the FATF process is onerous, but what we initially saw as a challenge eventually came to be seen as an opportunity to prove ourselves,” he said. “Now, we have a stronger grasp on how to assess and incorporate international standards into our regime, and our inter-governmental approach locally has vastly improved our effectiveness in fighting financial crime, including internationally.

“So today’s outcome confirms our reputation as a well-regulated jurisdiction in AML matters,” Minister Ebanks said. “We have demonstrated that we are a global partner in financial services. And with this tremendous achievement, the Cayman Islands is on the move, looking to bolster our commercial offerings for sound business, and our corresponding compliance regime.”

Welcoming the news, the Premier, the Hon. Wayne Panton, said: “This is the culmination of the tireless efforts, advocacy and diplomacy from the Attorney General, Minister Ebanks, and countless public servants across various ministries, portfolios, law enforcement and regulatory bodies. Our financial services industry also gave their full cooperation, walking every step of this journey with us; and our public has been very supportive of our progress in meeting the FATF standard. We all are proud of this tremendous achievement, and its reinforcement of the sound reputation of the Cayman Islands.”","The Cayman Islands is celebrating today after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) removed them from its anti-money laundering “grey list”, determining that their AML regime now meets the global standard. After two years of hard work and dedication from the public and private sectors, the Cayman Islands is now recognized as a well-regulated jurisdiction in AML matters, and a global partner in financial services, a testament to the tireless efforts of countless public servants and the full cooperation of the financial services industry."

School board

Six candidates — four Democrats and two Republicans — are running to fill four open seats on the Board of Education this November.

Of those contenders, five are competing for three full three-year terms on the board. One candidate — incumbent board president and Democrat Jackie Heftman — is running unopposed for a one-year seat to finish out the term originally held by Democrat Ben Lee, who resigned in 2022.

Democrat Jackie Pioli was appointed to fill Lee's seat, but Pioli failed to gain the endorsement of the Democratic City Committee this summer to be on the ballot for the upcoming election and decided not to run. Fellow incumbent Democrat Fritz Chery, whose seat is one of the three full terms up for grabs in the election, also failed to receive an endorsement of the local party and will not appear on the ballot.

All of the positions up for election this year are currently held by Democrats, meaning Republican hopefuls will have to outperform at least one of the Democrat contestants to make it onto the board. In years when a Republican-held seat is up for election, the city's minority representation rule would allow the top performing Republican or minority party candidate to win a seat on the board.

The candidates who win will cast votes on the school district's annual budget, school building projects, policies and large contracts, among other responsibilities.

We asked all six candidates a set of questions, see how they responded.

Board of Finance

Four candidates are running for three seats on the city’s Board of Finance in the Nov. 7 election.

The six members of the Board of Finance have staggered four-year terms.

Democrats Mary Lou Rinaldi and Geoff Alswanger are seeking reelection to the board. Democrat Laura Burwick, who was appointed to fill a vacancy on the board last year, and Republican Thomas Kuczynski are also running.

Stamford residents will be able to vote for up to three candidates.

Here's how the Board of Finance candidates answered our questions.

Board of Reps

In addition to citywide offices, candidates for spots on the Board of Representatives are on the Nov. 7 ballot in certain districts.

Members of the Board of Representatives are elected, or re-elected, every four years. The city has 20 municipal districts, and two board members represent each one.

Since the 2021 election, five city representatives have resigned from their seats. The following candidates are running to finish out those former members’ terms, which end in late 2025.

In District 5, Democrat Dakary Watkins is running unopposed.

The District 7 race is between Democrat Christina Strain and Republican Michael Battinelli.

Democrat Kindrea Walston is running unopposed in District 9.

In District 18, Republican Stephen Garst and Democrat Karen Camporeale are running against each other.

Democrat Carl Weinberg and Republican Vito Quivelli are the two candidates in District 20.

Strain, Walston, Camporeale and Weinberg won Democratic primaries in September.

Watkins, Walston, Garst and Weinberg are currently serving as representatives of their districts, having been appointed to vacated seats.

See how the candidates answered our questions.","In the November 7th election, Stamford voters will be presented with a ballot including the Board of Finance, Board of Education, constables, and a city charter change question.

The survey was carried out at our Financial Services Insights event, which took place at The Round Room of the Mansion House, Dublin, and attracted 500 industry leaders. The event focused on current global political tensions, their potential macro-financial effects and the path forward for Ireland’s financial services sector in a time of change and challenge.

One-third (33%) of respondents said that the re-election of Donald Trump is the biggest medium-term threat to global security. 25% were most concerned about authoritarian China and potential conflict over Taiwan, while 22% said that climate change presented the biggest threat. 20% believe that Russia continuing the land war in Europe will be the biggest cause of geopolitical instability.

Alastair Campbell, political commentator and co-host of The Rest is Politics podcast, delivered a keynote address at the event and said: “I cannot recall a time when so many major geopolitical and geo-strategic issues were creating such a difficult environment for decision makers. The current crisis in the Middle East is but the latest with the potential to affect all of us in large ways and small. The climate crisis, AI, the seeming rise of autocracy and the fear that Trump could return to the White House, economic nationalism, the war in Ukraine, a succession of coups across Africa … there is certainly a lot to talk about and it is a pleasure to do so with so many important Irish business voices.”

Populism isn’t about what is popular; instead it is a form of politics that sees a problem as something to be exploited instead of something to be solved.



The survey also found that more than 4 out of 10 (42%) Financial Services leaders believe the UK will be back in the European Union by 2040, indicating that the question of the UK's long-term relationship with the EU remains unsettled in the minds of many.

Alastair Campbell commented: “Populism isn’t about what is popular; instead it is a form of politics that sees a problem as something to be exploited instead of something to be solved. Nobody now thinks Brexit is going well. So I think at some point it has to be fixed. I hope we get back into the European Union at some point. I think leaving was the biggest act of self-destructive folly. But I look at the European Union now and I think the question is also, what sort of European Union are we talking about?”

Commenting on the event, Neil Campbell, Partner and Head of Financial Services, said: ""Our Financial Services lawyers are deeply cognisant of the geopolitical issues shaping both the sector and the nation at large. This event is an opportunity for industry leaders to reflect not only on the broader macroeconomic factors at play, but also the critical leadership qualities required in these turbulent times, and the path forward for Ireland’s Financial Services sector amidst these evolving dynamics.”

Scattered Spider, the threat gang responsible for recent attacks against MGM International and Caesars Entertainment, amongst others, has been described by Microsoft as “one of the most dangerous financial criminal groups.""

In an Oct. 25 post, Microsoft’s threat intelligence team detailed what it describes as Scattered Spider’s “extensive range” of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), saying the gang “crosses boundaries to facilitate extortion, encryption, and destruction.”

Scattered Spider’s destructive capabilities were on full display in Las Vegas in September when it crippled multiple IT systems across several MGM properties in a sprawling attack that exposed customer data and cost the company around $100 million.

Tracked by Microsoft as Octo Tempest, and also known as 0ktapus and UNC3944, the gang began deploying ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware in the middle of this year and has focused its attacks on VMware ESXi servers.

As well as having an extensive arsenal of TTPs that enable it to successfully attack complex hybrid environments, Scattered Spider’s prowess is further enhanced by its ability to carry out what Microsoft calls “social engineering with a twist.”

“The threat actor performs research on the organization and identifies targets to effectively impersonate victims, mimicking idiolect on phone calls and understanding personal identifiable information to trick technical administrators into performing password resets and resetting multifactor authentication (MFA) methods,” the threat intelligence team said.

“These actors use personal information, such as home addresses and family names, along with physical threats to coerce victims into sharing credentials for corporate access.”

Scattered Spider's native English speakers effective in launching social-engineering campaigns

Microsoft’s post included screenshots of text messages sent to a victim of the gang, threatening to dispatch a shooter to their home if they did not provide their login credentials.

Delinea cybersecurity evangelist Tony Goulding said organizations should be very concerned about the group’s blend of sophisticated techniques, the broad scope of industries it targeted, and its aggressive approach.

“Being native English speakers, they can more effectively launch wide-ranging social-engineering campaigns compared to BlackCat,” he said.

“We have worked 17 engagements in the past three months involving this threat actor, and the most dangerous element is their expertise in almost every known technology solution on the planet,” said Fenix24 co-founder Heath Renfrow.

“They leverage this expertise to gain entry into environments and then compromise virtually everything, much more quickly than traditionally seen.”

Expect to be tracked, taunted and threatened

Microsoft warned network defenders that Scattered Spider’s use of social engineering and living-off-the-land techniques, together with its strong capabilities across a wide range of toolsets, could necessitate a “slight unorthodox” approach to hunting the group.

The post outlined a detailed hunting methodology, including centralizing visibility of any administrative changes in the environment and scrutinizing changes to administrator groups, roles and privileges.

Phishing-resistant MFA should be required for all administrator accounts, the researchers said.

They also warned the group had been observed joining, recording and transcribing calls, and sending messages, on its victim’s corporate communications platforms. This activity was used to taunt and threaten staff, and to gain insights into incident response operations and planning.

“Using out-of-band communication channels is strongly encouraged when dealing with this threat actor,” Microsoft said.

Critical Start cyber threat research senior manager Callie Guenther said regular cybersecurity training for employees, focused on evolving social engineering tactics, should be part of an organization’s holistic defense strategy.

“Adhering to the principle of least privilege ensures restricted access, and encrypted communications can safeguard sensitive exchanges. Above all, a well-defined and rehearsed incident response plan is crucial to counter unexpected breaches effectively,” Guenther said.","ussing on recognizing phishing emails, was “critical” in protecting against the group.Scattered Spider, tracked by Microsoft as Octo Tempest, is a financial criminal group with an extensive range of tactics, techniques, and procedures.

For the first time, a broadcast network will use drones as part of its coverage of the baseball championship. (Drones have previously been used for coverage of the All-Star Game, however.)

The drones will join Fox’s UmpCam as part of its coverage of the World Series. That innovation made its debut in the American League Divisional Series, offering an umpire’s view of pitches, plays, and big hits. (Those cameras are installed at the top of the home plate umpire’s mask.) The network also plans to position more than 100 microphones around the stadium to capture the sounds from players and fans.

While Fox is touting the technology, it does not plan to use drones to follow live action in the game. They’ll be dispatched as players head into the dugout or walk from the bullpen to the pitcher’s mound. Only one of the three (named the “Gimbal Bee,” “Hummer Lite,” and “Hummingbird”) will be in the air at a time, and they’ll be stationed between the outfield and the bullpens.

Each drone will be operated by two people, one to pilot the device and another who will operate the gimbal on the drone, looking for the best shot and angle.

While this is a first for the World Series, Fox has been utilizing drones in its sports coverage since 2018, when it used them as part of its broadcast of the Daytona 500.

Drones first became a part of sports broadcasting in 2015, though, when the NFL was the first major sports league to get FAA approval to use them. Two years later, they were a part of the Super Bowl halftime show.

The 2023 World Series kicks off Friday night at 8:03 p.m. ET on Fox."," For the first time, the broadcast will feature drones hovering in the air, along with an UmpCam and over 100 microphones to capture the sounds of the game."

Here’s what you need to know about the world of digital identity and biometrics today:

Pakistan’s Central Bank Mandates Biometric IDV for Branchless Banking

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has announced that branchless banking service providers will have to use biometric identity verification (IDV) for their customers starting January 31, 2024. Such verification will be mandated for any situations in which cash is deposited or withdrawn. SBP is encouraging all Authorized Financial Institutions in the country to deploy biometric verification devices at their physical locations, particularly those operating in areas deemed to be high risk for terrorist financing.

Facial Recognition Deployment Led to Three Arrests: Essex Police

Police in the United Kingdom’s Essex county say their deployment of live facial recognition technology this week led to the arrests of three individuals — one on an outstanding warrant, another as part of a robbery investigation, and a third suspected of rape. Essex Police had previously warned that the public deployments would take place on October 24 and 25, explaining that individuals would be matched against watch lists. The tech was borrowed from South Wales Police. “This was a really positive first deployment of Live Facial Recognition technology in Essex,” commented Detective Superintendent Stephen Jennings. “The vans also acted as a talking point with the public and gave us an opportunity to speak to them about its use and how it works. I’m pleased to say that the reaction we’ve had has been overwhelmingly positive.”

Colorado Cops Mull Return of Facial Recognition After IT Partner Change

Police in the small Colorado town of Wheat Ridge are considering re-introducing facial recognition technology to their arsenal, thanks to a change in the product portfolio offered by their technology partner, Lumen. In 2020, Lumen’s FRT vendor stopped offering the technology, meaning the police no longer had access to it. Now, Lumen has found a new vendor, and the Wheat Ridge Police Department has organized meetings with the public to get feedback on its plans to reinstate the tech. One took place this week, with the others to follow on November 15 and November 29.

Detego Global Launches Face Matching Tool

Detego Global, a subsidiary of the British digital forensics and endpoint monitoring specialist MCM Solutions, has launched a facial recognition tool that it says is twice as fast as the industry average. Detego Analyse AI+ can be deployed on a desktop or laptop, and allows investigators to compile watchlists of suspects, witnesses, victims, and so on. The platform also supports functions including object detection and Optical Character Recognition.

FPC’s Optical Under-Display Sensor Gets Million-Unit Order

Fingerprint Cards says it has received a one-million-unit purchase order for its optical under-display fingerprint sensor, the first time it has reached such a milestone since the company got its first volume purchase order for the solution in December of last year. The company says the order comes from “an Asian smartphone OEM”, though it hasn’t named the client. “We see continued growth in the under-display fingerprint sensor segment, and the fact that we have just received the largest purchase order for our under-display solution to date, for a million units, is testimony to the strength of our technology,” said Haiyuan Bu, the President of FPC’s Mobile, PC & Access China unit. While mobile sensors clearly remain a central component of FPC’s business, the company is seeking to diversify into new areas, and to that end launched a sensor system tailored for PCs this week.

UK’s Online Safety Bill Gets Royal Assent

The United Kingdom’s Online Safety Bill has now received royal assent, officially coming into law. Approved by parliament in September, the legislation requires online publishers to implement age verification processes for content deemed inappropriate for minors. This could lead to more business for certified Identity Service Providers such as Yoti, which is pitching its age estimation and identity verification tools as means to comply with the law. But this will depend to some extent on Ofcom, the country’s communication regulator, which is responsible for drafting codes of practice. “We encourage Ofcom to clarify how they wish to see user verification undertaken, with proportionality and inclusion in mind,” Yoti said in a new blog post.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,House Down Payments Are the Highest in These 5 Cities | Money,https://money.com/highest-lowest-house-down-payments/,"Traditional homebuying wisdom says that putting at least 20% of the sale price toward the down payment is likely to satisfy mortgage lenders, especially in hot markets.

That goal may seem unattainable for the average homebuyer these days — the median-priced U.S. home has surged to $429,500, making a 20% down payment a whopping $85,900, according to data from Realtor.com. However, a recent analysis from the brokerage found that there are plenty of markets where homebuyers put down a much smaller amount on average.

Realtor.com looked at real estate data in the 150 largest metropolitan areas from the firm Optimal Blue to find out which U.S. cities had the biggest — and smallest — average down payments in the third quarter of 2023.

Down payments in the current housing market

Homebuyers are generally encouraged to put down at least 20% of the home sale price to avoid paying private mortgage insurance. That target is even more ideal now that mortgage rates are near 8% — Realtor.com says that many buyers prefer to make bigger down payments so they don’t have to pay interest on their mortgages.

But home prices are now outpacing what many Americans earn: A recent report from property data firm ATTOM found that in more than half of local markets analyzed, homebuyers needed annual wages of more than $75,000 to afford the costs associated with the average home.

There is a silver lining, though, according to Realtor.com. Over the last year, down payments have decreased, with buyers putting down an average of 13.8% of the sale price last quarter (which includes July, August and September). That’s down from 14.7% a year prior.

What's more, Realtor.com’s analysis found that down payments were much lower in areas near military bases because active service members and veterans can take advantage of 0% loans through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Qualifying homebuyers can also use Department of Agriculture and Federal Housing Administration loans, the latter of which allow buyers to put down as little as 3.5%. And there is no shortage of down payment assistance programs across the country. Most of these DPA programs offer cash grants for home purchases that can be also be used for other closing costs, but assistance can also come in the form of low or no-interest loans. Some states even offer programs specifically for certain professions, like first responders and teachers.

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,New data shows continued increase in Vermont short-term rentals,https://www.vhfa.org/news/blog/new-data-shows-continued-increase-vermont-short-term-rentals,"New data on Vermont’s short-term rental (STR) market now available on HousingData.org shows a continued increase, up to 11,747 homes statewide in September 2023. Additionally, historic data has been added to the site, now displaying monthly figures, starting in October 2014.

The data shows continued growth in the number of homes used as STRs, with a 16% increase in the number of homes used as STRs statewide in September 2023 compared to the same month in the year earlier. September 2023 had the most active STRs (11,747 homes) and reservations (51,290 reservations) out of any month in Vermont on record. Average monthly revenue per rental slightly dipped from September 2022 to 2023, landing at $4,181 for the month. This leveling out comes after three years of significant revenue growth per STR since the beginning of the pandemic.

The hosts of Vermont’s growing ranks of homes used as STRs range from Vermont residents to individuals who live overseas. Fifty-five percent (55%) of the hosts of Vermont STRs were Vermont residents, based on preliminary analysis of March 2023 data. The remaining hosts were primarily from northeastern states, including New York (13%) Massachusetts (10%), Connecticut (6%) and New Jersey (5%). Data about host location was available for 51% of all Vermont STRs that month. Data on STR host characteristics is not yet available on HousingData.org.

What are Short-Term Rentals? (STRs)

Short-term rentals (STRs) are typically furnished apartments rented for short periods of time, instead of being annually leased or owner occupied. They are often used by travelers as an alternative to a hotel, as they may feature different amenities, prices, and locations than more traditional lodging. Vermonter’s opening their homes for short stays is not a new phenomenon. Today, traditional bed & breakfasts can still be found in many of the state’s historic downtowns, with some having first welcomed guests more than 100 years ago and others opening new to this day.

However, the practice has changed dramatically since the introduction of web-based listing sites such as AirBNB and Vrbo. Today, the ease of listing a home (or part of one) has led to the proliferation of homeowners doing so who may not otherwise have felt comfortable with this even ten years ago. In 2014, just over 1,000 homes statewide were listed on these sites as short-term rentals, according to AirDNA. More than 11,000 homes were actively used as short-term rentals for at least one night in Vermont in September 2023. That figure only includes full-unit rentals; partial homes, shared rooms, resorts, and traditional bed and breakfasts listed on these sites have been excluded.

Data about the short-term rental market in this data set includes listings collected by industry analyst AirDNA. AirDNA aggregates listings from several popular STR rental platforms, including AirBNB, HomeAway, and Vrbo. The VHFA (Vermont Housing Finance Agency) Research & Community Relations team uses a series of data processing techniques to update the public view on HousingData.org on a regular basis. Our team is working to refine the view with more useful data points to better display how changes in the STR market may be impacting the state’s larger housing market. In this process, we have re-spatialized the dataset to be more comparable to other housing metrics found on the site, with STR figures available for every Vermont town.

Vermont’s short-term rental conditions in September 2023

From the data, it is clear that the number of STRs in Vermont has significantly increased over time, with a marked increase in the number of units in the last three years. The larger trend was briefly halted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated travel restrictions, apparent in the stark decline in active homes in May 2020. From February 2021 onwards, the STR market made a swift recovery. There were about as many active STR homes in September 2019 (8,583 homes) as there were in September 2021 (8,237). The growth continued, with an additional ~1,700 units listed as STRs each year in September 2022 (10,131) and 2023 (11,747).

The data shows a seasonal cycle in the number of active STRs in the state. In this model, a unit is considered active if the home was listed and rented for at least one day in the noted month. Annually, September and October have the highest number of active STRs statewide. February, March, and November notably feature a lower active home total annually. This tracks with seasonal weather patterns and tourism trends.

The demand to stay in Vermont STRs has continuously increased over this period as well. In Sept. 2019, there were 33,892 full unit STR reservations in Vermont. Despite pandemic conditions that both hindered travel and limited the number of STRs available to rent, guests made 24,419 reservations at STRs in Vermont during Sept. 2020. Reservations made a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels in September 2021 and have continued to rise since. There were 51,290 STR reservations in Vermont in September 2023.

These changes are also reflected in the average monthly revenue per STR. Average revenue was below $2,000 in all months prior to June 2018, slowly rising to $2,460 by September 2019. That number jumped to $3,256 in 2020, then again to $3,948 in 2021. The rate of increase leveled out after that point, increasingly less drastically to $4,040 in Sept. 2022 and then $4,181 in 2023. However, it’s worth noting that average monthly revenue crossed $5,000 for the first time in February 2023. By contrast, the median gross rent in 2021 for a year-round rented Vermont home was $1,070 according to the Census Bureau.

Short-Term Rentals and Vacation Homes

It is likely that many homes listed consistently as short-term rentals are counted as seasonal homes by the Census. The Census Bureau categorizes any home not occupied by, or available to, a full-time renter or homeowner as “vacant.” Thus, “seasonal, vacation, or occasional use” homes are tracked by the Census as a type of vacant home.

Towns with the most short-term rental listings are consistently the ski resort towns of Stowe, Killington, Ludlow, Dover, and Warren. These towns are also the state’s top locations for the number of seasonal homes. Vermont’s seasonal homes account for about 16% of the state’s total housing stock, according to the Census Bureau. Short-Term Rentals account for about 3.6%, but from the data we cannot determine the overlap between these two figures.

Data shows that seventy-one percent (71%) of Vermont’s vacant homes are “seasonal, occasional use, or vacation homes” (44,057 homes). Vermont’s long-standing preponderance of seasonal homes offers a stark contrast to its extreme shortage of another type of vacant home—those for sale (4%). Only Maine had greater rates in both metrics than Vermont, at 72% and 4% respectively. While some of these seasonal homes could be used as year-round homes, many properties are unlikely to change status. At least some seasonal homes are unheated hunting cabins, lakeside camps with limited septic systems, or condominiums within ski resorts that are not suitable for year-round use.

The Department of Health — Abu Dhabi (DoH), the regulator of the healthcare sector in the emirate, has temporarily shut down two healthcare facilities.

This action was taken in response to a series of violations observed by the department's healthcare quality team. One medical centre has been closed temporarily pending the completion of investigations and regulatory procedures related to financial violations.

Additionally, a one-day surgery centre has been temporarily closed due to violations that pose a significant threat to the health and safety of community members.

DoH clarified that the medical centre was temporarily closed, and a doctor was suspended until necessary investigations were concluded. These actions were taken in response to several breaches, including the falsification of documentation for procedures, examinations, medical interventions, and treatments differing from the actual care provided.

The violations also included non-compliance with the department’s circulars, policies, and regulations, such as failure to obtain the patient's consent for treatment, failure to communicate treatment procedures and associated risks before commencing treatment, as well as the use of an unauthorised facility name that diverges from the one designated by DoH.

Meanwhile, the one-day surgery centre was suspended until it rectifies its safety conditions and procedures. This step is a response to the severe threats posed by the observed violations to the well-being and safety of our community members, including the facility's failure to adhere to radiation protection standards or essential shielding equipment and materials, for both employees and patients. The facility also breached protocols by not maintaining and calibrating medical devices and by failing to comply with accredited training systems for its workforce.

Further, a series of violations related to infectious disease prevention standards and regulations were identified. These violations included non-compliance with the federal law concerning infectious disease prevention as well as a breach of the department's directive mandating the use of an electronic reporting system, whether among employees or patients. Moreover, the facility failed to adhere to infection prevention measures and requirements, as evidenced by a visit from the department's healthcare quality team.

Furthermore, the facility was found to be non-compliant with standards and protocols for handling hazardous materials, medical waste disposal, building and vital systems maintenance, and fire safety procedures established by DoH and the Abu Dhabi Civil Defence Authority.

DoH called on all health facilities operating in the emirate to comply with its policies and regulations to preserve the efficiency of the healthcare system in Abu Dhabi, preserve the health and safety of all community members, and continue providing healthcare services in accordance with international best practices.

The department affirmed that it will continue to dedicate efforts to ensure the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of healthcare services provided, by exerting its supervisory role to monitor violations and assist violating facilities to correct any shortfalls to achieve the health and safety of all members of society.

The donation was made at the North Tongu District Assembly at Mepe in the Volta Region after Mr Ofori-Atta led a delegation to visit the affected areas on Friday.

Staff of the Finance Ministry also donated an amount of GH¢50,000 towards the same course.

Mr Ofori-Atta noted, “Let us be encouraged, Ministry of Finance as a family concerned about what has happened to our brothers and sisters, working with the VRA, we have brought something enough of GHS2 million to be able to support the relief that is going on and to thank Ghanaians for the spontaneous response.”

He further indicated “Clearly we are also prepared in terms of safe havens that had been put in place. So we are looking forward to supporting immediately as people have done and also looking long term to make sure that alternatives are provided.

“The issue of returning to homes is not a simple decision because of the issues of health. And so we need to put something into place to have access to capital to ensure that people can construct much faster than otherwise.”

Mr Ofori-Atta also announced that long-term relief measures for the victims of the Akosombo Dam spillage will be taken into consideration during the formulation of the 2024 budget.

Speaking to journalists on Friday, Mr Ofori-Atta indicated that though the government had made some relief items available for victims, the government was going to continue to do more and also capture it in next year’s budget.

“We have mobilized a few things that we would like to share but I think we are also in the budget season and therefore it will not just be numbers that we are working on but true feelings in the field and therefore the need to look at these social interventions in a real way. We will certainly give this an expression immediately and

also in the budget,” he stated.

Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) has said that the water levels have started dropping.","The Ghanaian government has donated GH¢2 million to support people affected by the Akosombo Dam spillage, with the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, leading a delegation to visit the affected areas.

The college was celebrated at the IFT (Institute for Turnaround) Annual Awards in London, which showcases ‘the very best in turnaround and transformation practice and outcomes’.

It was named runner-up in the Community Impact category, having been nominated by Barclays.

The awards dinner at the Rosewood Hotel was attended by key individuals and firms including advisers, investors, lawyers and lenders.

Graham Guest took over as principal and chief executive in 2017 to oversee the merger between Telford College of Arts & Technology and New College Telford.

At the time, the college was declared financially ‘inadequate’ after racking up multi-million pound deficits for three consecutive years, and had been given a ‘requires improvement’ grading by Ofsted.

Today it is officially recognised as financially ‘Outstanding’ after delivering a surplus for the past four years, and has been upgraded to ‘Good’ by Ofsted.

Mr Guest, who attended the awards dinner with deputy chief executive Janet Stephens, said: “This recognition is testament to the hard work and dedication of so many members of the Telford College team.

“We also owe a debt of gratitude to the many supporters and stakeholders who supported and believed in us along the way.

“One of the cornerstones of our strategic plan is to work even more closely with the Shropshire business community. We are very keen to ensure we play a role in putting something back into the local economy.”

The awards came a day after Telford College was also involved in a reception at the House of Lords to mark ‘Love Our Colleges’ week, and representatives met Education Secretary Gillian Keegan and shadow leaders from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to discuss future plans for further education.

Janet Stephens said: “It was a very productive couple of days – great profile for Telford College, and fantastic to be able to contribute to such high-level debates around the skills revolution.”

In the latest Ofsted report for Telford College, inspectors said: “Senior leaders and governors have worked well to ensure the corporation has the skills to provide appropriate support and challenge to senior leaders.","”Telford College of Arts and Technology was recognized by the Institute for Turnaround at the Annual Awards in London for its financial turnaround and transformation under the leadership of Graham Guest and Janet Stephens.

New plans published by Scottish Financial Enterprise (SFE) aim to unlock £7bn in gross value added (GVA) for the Scottish economy by 2028.

The member body representing Scotland’s financial and related professional services industry has launched its vision for sector growth, making the most of the nation's technology and ecosystem advantages.

The strategy has been developed in collaboration with City of London Corporation, TheCityUK, FinTech Scotland and the Global Ethical Finance Initiative, and is supported by both the Scottish and UK governments.

Financial and related professional services are already the largest contributor to the Scottish economy, adding around £14.3bn GVA annually. The industry directly employs around 136,000 people, with many thousands more in the supply chain - and with salaries a third higher than the average wage in Scotland.

The statement suggested that industry leaders believe Scotland is uniquely well placed to respond to the key trends shaping the future, including growth in sustainable finance and fintech, as well as the rise of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The strategy aims to harness Scotland’s human capital to fuel innovation and fill skills gaps, enhance Scotland’s capability as a key regional technology hub and develop Scotland’s finance ecosystem to attract investment.

The set of actions are focused on collaboration, communication and technological innovation, with targets including:

Grow GVA from £14.3bn to between £17bn and £21bn in five years.

Double assets under management in Scotland’s financial services sector to £1trn by 2030.

Propel Scotland to the top regional financial centres globally, as measured by the Global Financial Centres Index.

Ensure that Edinburgh reaches a position of being among the top 20 global financial centres, with Glasgow in the top 30.

Increase the sector’s economic contribution to, and wider impact on, society in Scotland.

SFE chief executive Sandy Begbie said: “Achieving sustainable, inclusive, economic growth is vital if we are to create more of the high-wage, high-skill jobs our country needs to raise living standards and properly fund public services.

“Financial services must be at the heart of this ambition, Scotland’s world-class finance ecosystem is an essential pillar of our economy, and we believe there is even greater potential just waiting to be unleashed.

“Our sector growth strategy will unleash that potential and deliver long-term sustainable growth, and we are determined to make sure that everyone in Scotland feels the benefits.”

Minister for Small Business, Trade and Innovation Richard Lochhead said: “Scotland’s financial services sector is one of our prized industries, offering significant opportunities for economic growth and attracting further investment.

“By capitalising on our great strengths, and continuing to develop our innovative approach in emerging areas such as fintech and data, the coming years present an exciting time for the sector to play a leading role in growing a prosperous economy for everyone.”

Scotland’s banking sector has also agreed on a plan to ensure every Scot is offered a basic bank account.

Part of SFE's new plans, it will work with banking and fintech members, Financial Inclusion for Scotland and the Financial Conduct Authority, to help improve access to basic financial services for people who might currently be excluded from the banking system.

It is estimated as many as 100,000 people in Scotland - and more than a million across the UK - do not have a bank account, with vulnerable groups like homeless people, refugees, ethnic and religious minority groups often more likely to lack access.

The new sector growth strategy outlines how innovations in data and artificial intelligence could help make access to banking services more inclusive.

SFE has also pledged to help further improve financial literacy and access to affordable credit.

Begbie said: “Scotland’s financial services industry is determined to show leadership on this issue, and ensuring every Scot has been offered access to a basic bank account is a good place to start.

“By working Scotland’s vibrant banking and fintech sectors, and harnessing developments in data and artificial intelligence, we can make sure more people have access to a bank account and no one is excluded from the system.”

2023-10-27T00:00:00.0000000,Five key money conversations every couple needs to have,https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/whats-on/be/five-key-money-conversations-every-27993952,"For many couples, discussing money can help them to plan for the longer term and make sure their financial goals are in harmony.

But a recent survey from Starling Bank indicates that a quarter (24%) of married couples, and 30% of people in a committed relationship, do not disclose all about their finances to each other.

This is the sort of thing Talk Money Week (November 6-10) aims to tackle, as it encourages people to open up more about their finances. According to Starling Bank’s survey, one in seven (14%) of those in a relationship say they don’t know what their partner earns, including 9% of those who are married, while nearly a fifth (19%) of couples manage their finances separately, including 12% who are married.

Anna Clayden, a 23-year-old junior advertising creative from London, has been in a relationship with her partner, a business adviser, for over a year, and says the couple don’t discuss salaries right now. “I think, as he knows what my job role is, he has somewhat of an idea of the salary I’m on,” she says – adding that, in some circumstances, discussing incomes could be the right step to take: “If we were to move in together and potentially buy a house, then I think we would need to discuss it, as it is such a big financial decision.”

While some couples may not feel they need to discuss salaries or other financial topics in their relationship at the moment, others may be considering how they can get the conversation started.

Putting time in the diary for a “money date”, when you’re both not too busy and have time to focus, could be a good way to kick things off.

It’s also important to remember that people have different attitudes towards money, so try to avoid being judgemental or bringing blame into the conversation. One of you may be more naturally inclined to squirrel money away and the other may be more of a spender.

Rachel Kerrone, a family finance expert at Starling Bank, says: “Talking about money can help couples ensure their financial goals, concerns and priorities align and create trust in each other to manage finances responsibly.”

To get the ball rolling, here are some aspects of finances that Kerrone suggests couples could discuss…

1. Saving strategies

Kerrone says: “If you’re able to save, it’s good to talk about it. Whether you’re planning to renovate a jointly-owned property or purchase a new car with your partner, you may want to save for these goals together. Get stuck into the details, including whether you’ll contribute equally to savings or if contributions will be proportional to your incomes.

“You can also talk about how you’ll manage savings for joint projects and explore long-term financial priorities, such as saving for a home, retirement or education and establish a plan to work towards them together. You might also want to maintain an emergency fund in a joint account and decide how much you should collectively save for unexpected expenses.”

2. Your incomes and outgoings

Kerrone adds: “I always recommend being transparent about all things money with your partner, including how much you both earn, whether either of you own a property and how much the mortgage payments are. Debt is another, slightly uncomfortable but important topic to be open and honest about.”

If you’re curious, you can read our Privacy Notice .

3. The ‘awkward stuff’

Kerrone says it can be useful to discuss your credit score with your partner, and understand the implications of sharing an account before deciding if joint financial activities would work for you both.

“If your joint account goes into its overdraft, both of you will be responsible for the debt, so you’ll need to think about how you’ll handle debt and overdraft situations together,” she adds.

4. Budgeting

“Creating a joint budget can help give couples more control and insight into their joint spending,” says Kerrone. “You can calculate essential expenses like rent, utilities, childcare and groceries, and decide how you’ll divide these costs.”

She highlights using a “budget planner”, adding: “Beyond these essential expenses, it’s worth discussing your individual spending habits, both the good and the bad, to ensure that you’re on the same page.”

5. Your own financial independence

Kerrone adds: “If you do decide to open a joint account with your partner, it’s not something you should rush into, and you need to completely trust the person you’re applying with. It’s important to have your own separate bank account too, so you can have financial independence when needed.”

Remember too that, if the relationship were to end, you could contact credit reference agencies to ask for associations with the other person to be removed, if you no longer share financial links with each other.

In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Garth Klintworth – Absa Group Head of Global Markets – discusses the seventh iteration of the Absa Africa Financial Markets Index (AFMI).

Before joining Absa, Klintworth was a Derivatives Manager in Treasury for the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, and then became a Treasurer at JP Morgan.

Klintworth joined Absa Group Limited – then Barclays Africa Group – in July 2009, and served as Head of FI Rates, Currencies and Commodities.

He was appointed Head of Trading for Barclays Africa in April 2013, before taking on his current role.

Interview

In this interview, Klintworth discusses the importance of publishing the Absa AFMI yearly.

He explains how partnering with the OMFIF shows that the AFMI is independent, and details how much of Africa the index covers.

Klintworth then comments on the key findings of the index for 2023 – including that scores are rising overall, and most countries now incorporate ESG-linked financial policies.

He discusses which nations were particularly interesting to him, and concludes by explaining how Absa will ensure that the AFMI remains a yardstick for Africa.

KPMG has found Australia’s funds management industry continues to see significant growth with $4.31 trillion in funds under management (FUM) – an increase of 13 per cent from $3.81 trillion in June 2020. However, just 6.5 per cent of overall FUM in Australia is sourced from overseas, compared to 78 per cent in Singapore, 90 per cent in Ireland and 95 per cent in Luxembourg.

CEO of the FSC, Blake Briggs said: “Australia has a globally sophisticated funds management industry, with low fees by global standards, but is missing out on the opportunity to manage offshore due to regulatory and tax policy settings that fall short of international peer comparisons.

“The significant foreign capital managed in other financial centres is not an accident. This has been achieved through a deliberate focus by these jurisdictions on regulatory and tax reform that support the global attractiveness and competitiveness of their funds management sectors.





Change is required to help Australia compete globally

The report makes a number of recommendations to enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of Australia’s funds management industry.

Key recommendations include:

Developing transition arrangements to deliver a globally competitive Corporate Collective Investment Vehicle.

Updating and reviewing a variety of tax rules so that Australian managed vehicles are competitive with other financial centre jurisdictions.

A mechanism for old legacy funds management products to be converted into modern products to deliver better outcomes for consumers and encourage product innovation.

Legislating climate-related financial risk disclosures for Australia’s significant businesses to allow fund managers to improve pricing of climate risks; and

Continued examination of the Your Future Your Super performance test to avoid unintended consequences and to ensure the test approach and benchmarks are not adversely constraining investment decisions.

A copy of the full report is available here.

Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Barbara Creecy, has expressed concern that developing nations have continually called for more support for the financing of the fight against climate change, yet the funding targets pledged by developed countries are still not being met.

“At the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28), there will be a renewed call for a scaled-up and predictable goal for climate finance. The deadline for agreeing upon this goal is 2024, and the success of this COP, and perhaps future climate talks, will depend on the outcome,” Creecy said on Thursday.

She was addressing the National Stakeholder consultations on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 28.

“Whilst the establishment of a global fund for loss and damage is indeed a milestone, the difficult task of working out the details of the fund – how it will be financed, where finance will come from, and the form of such finance – will be one of key agenda items in Dubai.

“As with all COPs, finance will remain a key issue. COP 28 therefore takes place in a context where we cannot simply congratulate ourselves for the apparent progress we have made whilst key issues still need to be addressed,” the Minister said.

COP28 to the UNFCCC will be held at Expo City, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30 November – 12 December 2023.

“At COP 27, South Africa and the Africa Group put forward the proposal to include the special needs and circumstances of the continent on the conference agenda, but this did not enjoy consensus. This proposal will be made again at COP 28.

“Acknowledging the special circumstances of the African continent will be an important step in upholding the principle of differentiated responsibility, and would recognise the continent’s vulnerability to climate change, but also the need for mitigation and adaptation support,” the Minister said.

She said the first Global Stocktake (GST) will be completed at COP28, where the world will take stock of the collective progress since adopting the Paris Agreement, and make recommendations where implementation of the Agreement is not on course to achieve its long-term goals.

“We already know we are not on track, based on the detailed evidence presented by Parties and other stakeholders during the technical dialogues of the GST over the last year. The outcome of the GST will be the central outcome of COP28, and this outcome must increase collective action on mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and the provision of support to developing countries to achieve this, commensurate with the challenges we face,” Creecy said.

She noted that the technical phase of the GST (in a series of technical dialogues) has made clear that, while action is proceeding under the Paris Agreement, much more is needed now on all fronts.

“The world is far better off than it would have been without the Paris Agreement and multilateral cooperation, but we are not on track to achieve the global goals we agreed to in Paris in 2015.

“The discussions on the outcome of the GST have started, and focus on key political messages, and more importantly, multilateral and national measures that need to be put in place to accelerate our journey towards a more sustainable and equitable world.

“As the co-facilitator of the consultations on the outcome of the political phase of the GST, together with Demark, South Africa is supporting the incoming Emirati COP Presidency to help identify areas of convergence and divergence between Parties in the run-up to and during COP28,” the Minister said.

She said at the past three COPs, the South African delegation has joined delegations from other developing countries in calling for a clear adaptation work programme with clear targets for building the resilience of developing countries and clear financial mechanisms to achieve this.

“To date there has been little or no progress on this matter,” the Minister said.

SA fully committed to addressing climate change

Creecy affirmed South Africa is commitment to addressing climate change based on science, equity and in the context of sustainable development.

“Hence, our updated Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) seek to balance the three structural components of mitigation, adaptation and the need for international support for implementation.

“Our Climate Change Bill, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Tuesday, will lay a strong legal basis for climate action, and the regulatory framework for the whole of government, business, organised labour and civil society to implement our country’s climate commitments,” the Minister said.

She said COP28 provides a key platform for broader conversations, including:

How developing countries in Africa can take advantage of their abundant renewable resources and strategic minerals to build shared prosperity and sustainable development on the continent;

The threat to sustainable development posed by unilateral trade measures imposed outside the Paris Agreement and in violation of its key principles, and

The pressing need for transformation of the global financial architecture to make the global financial system fit for purpose, in assisting countries to combat climate change and achieve their sustainable development goals.

At COP28, South Africa and other developing nations will be calling for a scaled-up and predictable goal for climate finance, as well as acknowledgment for the special needs and circumstances of the African continent. The Global Stocktake will also be completed to assess the collective progress since the adoption of the Paris Agreement and make recommendations for implementation."

Reuters / Brendan McDermid

The yield on the 10-year Treasury is now about same as the highest dividends paid by S&P 500 firms.

Bond yields have surged as investors fret over higher-for-longer interest rates.

Dividend funds have seen big outflows this year, Goldman Sachs said in a note.

The biggest yield paid by S&P 500 firms can't top the yield on the humble 10-year Treasury note .

In a note on Friday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the difference between the yield of the top 20% of S&P 500 dividend payers and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury has narrowed completely, from one percentage point in May to zero this week.

The gap between higher dividend yield stocks and the 10-year US Treasury yield has completely closed. Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

Getting similar yield for comparatively much less risk has led investors to pull cash from dividend stock funds at an faster pace than cash is flowing out of the overall stock market. Outflows from US equity dividend funds have more than doubled that of the broader market so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs data.

Investors are pulling out cash from dividend funds at an even faster pace than the overall stock market. Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

Meanwhile, strategists expect S&P 500 dividend growth to shrink over the next year, down from 5% this year to 4% in 2024.

That's partly due to sluggish corporate earnings this year as well as the lack of ""dividend paying capacity"" in the real estate and financial sectors, the bank said. S&P 500 earnings are expected to post a ""lackluster 1%"" growth through 2023.

The narrowing of the difference between dividend yields and the 10-year Treasury yield is another boost for the argument that bonds are a viable competitor to stocks, especially when considering the long-standing reputation of Treasurys as a nearly risk-free investment.

""Although our dividend forecasts imply upside to dividend futures, more liquid instruments now offer competitive yields. Today, a nominal 1-year US Treasury note yields 5.4%, offering roughly the same return on invested cash that investor could expect from buying and holding to maturity the 2024 S&P 500 dividend futures contract, assuming it converges without forecast,"" the bank said in a note.

Story continues

Dividend-yielding stocks are also unlikely to do well until the Fed begins to cut interest rates, strategists said, which probably won't happen soon. The Fed has warned rates in the economy could stay higher-for-longer is it continues to monitor inflation, which will weigh on dividend-paying companies.

""Our economists expect that the Fed will not deliver the first cut to the Fed Funds rate until the end of 2024. We believe that investors should wait until policy rate cuts are more clearly in view to begin buying dividend payers,"" the note added.

Bond yields have surged as investors adjust to the outlook for higher-for-longer interest rates, with the 10-year yield hovering around 4.86% on Friday. This week, the benchmark US government bond hit 5% for the first time since 2007.

Read the original article on Business Insider","The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has surged to 4.86%, matching the highest dividends paid by S&P 500 companies.

2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,U.S. imposes new sanctions to target Hamas funding,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/oct/28/us-imposes-new-sanctions-target-hamas-funding/,"The Biden administration has imposed a new round of sanctions on Hamas-linked officials to cut off the terror group’s investment fund and sever a conduit for Iranian financial support for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Treasury Department announced Friday.

Hamas controls a global portfolio of investments estimated to be worth more than $500 million with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.

“This investment network is directed by the highest levels of Hamas leadership and has allowed Hamas senior officials to live in luxury while ordinary Palestinians in Gaza struggle in harsh living and economic conditions,” the Treasury Department said last week after the first rounds of sanctions were announced.

Companies identified in the latest round of sanctions include the Spain-based Zawaya Group for Development Investment Sociedad Limitada and the Larrycom for Investment Company, owned by Abdelbasit Hamza Elhassan Mohamed Khair, a Hamas financier based in Sudan.

The Treasury Department also is targeting the Al-Ansar Charity Association which has been linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al-Ansar claims to be an extension of Iranian financial support to the Palestinian people but ultimately serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist activities, officials said.

The action “underscores the United States’ commitment to dismantling Hamas’ funding networks by deploying our counterterrorism sanctions authorities and working with our global partners to deny Hamas the ability to exploit the international financial system,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.

The Treasury Department also sanctioned several Iranian officials with links to Hamas, including commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who provided combat training to Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as well as Khaled Qaddoumi, a Jordanian national living in Tehran who serves as a liaison between Iran and Hamas.

The Treasury Department said all U.S.-based property and financial holdings belonging to those people and groups listed are blocked and must be reported to OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Anyone who engages with those on the sanctions list may also be subject to enforcement, officials said.

“We will not hesitate to take action to further degrade Hamas’ ability to commit horrific terrorist activity by relentlessly targeting its financial activities and streams of funding,” Mr. Adeyemo said.

This sanctions list includes companies operating in multiple countries, as well as several Iranian officials and a Jordanian national living in Tehran.

“Things have gone up,” Camerlo Johnson said of the world’s current state.

Many in Las Vegas told 8 News Now they are feeling the impact of inflation, sharing both frustrations and struggles over high prices.

“The regular 9 to 5 is not helping,” Julian Gonzalez said.

“If you’re just on your own,” Camerlo Johnson added. “It can be hard, it can be real hard out here.”

According to The U.S. Department of Labor, October’s current rate of inflation has been listed at 3.7 percent.

The figure is a lot lower than it was this time last year, but it’s still well above the Federal Reserve’s target of two percent.

“Right now,” Catey Hill, Managing Editor for MarketWatch said. “Your people are just feeling the strain.”

Therefore, people are doing anything possible to make ends meet, even raiding retirement funds.

Financial Firm Fidelity saw its highest number of 401k hardship withdrawals ever in 2022, listing a 2.4% share.

Experts like Hill don’t recommend this move, but she added that a lot of people don’t have a choice.

“When you tend to have lower incomes than other people,” Hill said. “Which makes it harder when you’re getting hit with student loan payments, and all these other things at one time.”

Many added that they have turned to retirement money, as higher interest rates have made loans and credit cards more difficult to pay.

“It’s bad when you get to a point where people have to take out their life savings,” Gonzalez said. “To use it right now.”

Many told 8 News Now the difficulties have hit them firsthand, adding that they hope to see something give in the near future.

“Can’t make ends meet,” Gonzalez concluded.

Anyone considering a 401k hardship withdrawal should keep in mind that it is only allowed under specific circumstances such as to pay medical bills not covered by insurance or to avoid foreclosure.

The withdrawal also comes with a 10% tax penalty.","As inflation continues to increase, financial firms are reporting a record number of 401k withdrawals as people are trying to make ends meet. People are raiding retirement funds due to higher interest rates making loans and credit cards difficult to pay, while the 10% tax penalty serves as a deterrent."

The agencies say Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB) will pay a total of $29.5 million in penalties for allowing criminals to open new accounts and misdirect a staggering $300 million.

According to the DFS, the bank issued its MovoCash digital prepaid visa card program to bad actors in 2020 because it did not use an adequate verification process to uncover the true identity of the applicants.

The thieves gave fraudulent identification and used their accounts to misdirect millions in direct deposit payroll payments and government benefits.

“MCB failed to prevent a massive, ongoing fraud in the MovoCash prepaid card program, allowing bad actors to abuse the financial system…

[MCB] observed a surge of fraudulent MovoCash account openings, and after failing to remedy the problem, allowed new MovoCash accounts to be opened.

This inaction allowed the fraud to increase exponentially over the next few months and facilitated more than $300 million in pandemic unemployment benefits to be misdirected to the MovoCash accounts of fraud actors.”

The Fed says it’s now forcing MCB to improve its customer identification, customer due diligence, and third-party risk management programs.

MCB has $6.683 billion in total assets with seven branches across New York.

2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,The Israel-Hamas war is affecting the financial outlooks of these large ...,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/the-israel-hamas-war-is-affecting-the-financial-outlooks-of-these-large-companies/3680366/,"Some of the world's most well-known companies are already seeing the Israel-Hamas war weighing on operations.

On Oct. 7, militant group Hamas struck Israeli towns in a surprise attack and took more than 200 hostages. More than 7,000 people have been killed in Gaza, per Palestinian health officials, while the Israeli Defense Forces said more than 1,400 have been killed in the country.

Corporations that do business or have operations in the region have already begun seeing the war change their financial outlooks as the unrest impacts everything from advertising dollars to tourism to supply chains. These early admissions come as world leaders grow increasingly concerned that the conflict will further intensify, with international calls for a cease-fire being rejected.

United Airlines said fourth-quarter performance could vary depending on the length of flight suspensions in Tel Aviv. Its updated range for adjusted earnings per share came in below analysts' forecasts.

""We have unmatched geographic diversity with a large domestic network complemented by the largest long-haul international network, and both are solidly profitable,"" CEO Scott Kirby said earlier this month. ""While this is a great attribute, it does create some short-term risk and volatility as we're seeing right now with the transitory hit to margins this quarter as a result of the tragedy in Israel.""

Travel changes

United is one of several carriers including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines that have rushed to change schedules as the conflict has unfolded. Notably, El Al, the Israeli flag carrier, said it would fly on the Jewish Sabbath for the first time in more than four decades to help bring reservists abroad back to the country.

Across the travel industry, the war is on the minds of corporate leaders. Plane-maker Boeing said in a regulatory filling that the conflict could affect certain suppliers, in addition to airlines.

About 1.5% of Royal Caribbean capacity in the fourth quarter had planned to visit Israel, CEO Jason Liberty said on the cruise line's earnings call on Thursday. Some of the adjusted sailings were previously expected have home ports in Haifa, a city in the northern region of the country.

Royal Caribbean also offered free use of its Rhapsody of the Seas vessel to the U.S. government to aid in the evacuation of Americans from Israel. Between the changed itineraries and use of the ship, the company estimated it would see an impact of 5 cents per share on its earnings. The firm expects to record between $6.58 and $6.63 in adjusted earnings per share for the year.

""I would … like to recognize the incredible effort from our shoreside teams and crew on board Rhapsody of the Seas, who have been working tirelessly with the U.S. Department of State to help safely evacuate Americans from Israel,"" Liberty said. ""My heartfelt gratitude goes out to all involved.""

Despite the changes, Liberty said the cruise line's customer base is sticky, so it may become more of a question of where they are going to travel rather than if they will cancel plans.

""They're going to go somewhere with us,"" he said. ""That's what we're focused on making sure they're doing.""

'Unpredictable nature'

Technology companies were among those seeing the conflict affect the workforce, advertising spending and supply chains.

Snap said in its latest earnings release that it saw pauses in spending from a ""large number of primarily brand-oriented advertising campaigns"" immediately after the war began. That has weighed on revenue so far in the current quarter.

While Snap some of the campaigns that initially paused have now resumed, the social media company has also seen others that didn't originally stop advertising do so. Snap said it would be ""imprudent"" to offer formal guidance on what to expect for the current quarter ""due to the unpredictable nature of war.""

Meta finance chief Susan Li said the Facebook and Instagram parent has seen softer advertising spending so far in the quarter, correlating in timeline with the start of the conflict. Li noted that it isn't necessarily due to any one event, but said cooler spending has historically aligned with the beginning of conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.

""This is something that we're continuing to monitor,"" Li told analysts during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. ""We've reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we've seen into our Q4 outlook — which, again, we think reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility in the landscape ahead.""

Align Technology is expecting increased headwinds and potential supply chain issues tied to the conflict, according to Chief Financial Officer John Morici. He said the fourth-quarter operating margin, when adjusted for generally accepted accounting principles, should be down from the prior three-month period as the medical device maker offers severance to adjust to headcount changes.

Multiple corporations including Aon and West Pharmaceutical noted a continued focus on supporting employees and their family members who live and work in the region. Israel is known in part for its vibrant startup and technology scene, with entrepreneurs and employers now wondering how to push forward in the new normal, especially as citizens get called to serve in reserve units.

ServiceNow CEO William McDermott said during the software company's call with analysts on Wednesday that employee Shlomi Sividia was among those killed at the Supernova Music Festival. He said Sividia was ""highly respected, admired and a good friend to many.""

""We stand in solidarity with our team and with their families. Terrorism has caused the unfathomable humanitarian crisis that now engulfs millions of people in Israel and Gaza,"" McDermott said. ""Our hearts pray for the innocent on all sides. Even with optimism in short supply, we choose to honor the dream of a peaceful and prosperous future for the Middle East region.""

Defense companies have also been on alert as another international conflict breaks out.

General Dynamics, the biggest U.S. artillery shell producer, had already been ramping up production to meet needs amid the war in Ukraine, according to finance chief Jason Aiken. Now, the company is working to increase production to as high as 100,000 units per month, up from 14,000.

""I think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand,"" Aiken said during General Dynamics' Wednesday earnings call.

— CNBC's Robert Hum, Morgan Brennan and Leslie Josephs contributed reporting.","i it ""can't predict the full impacts"" at this time.""As we think about our business, the unpredictable nature of the current environment is something we just have to be aware of,"" CEO Evan Spiegel said.
Leading companies such as United Airlines, Royal Caribbean, Boeing, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Snap are already feeling the economic impacts of the Israel-Hamas war. Flight suspensions, changed itineraries, pauses in advertising spending, and disruption of supply chains have all taken a toll on their operations and projected earnings."
2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,UN General Assembly calls for ‘humanitarian truce’ in Gaza,https://fortune.com/2023/10/28/israel-hamas-war-un-general-assembly-calls-for-humanitarian-truce-in-gaza/,"The U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution Friday calling for a “humanitarian truce” in Gaza leading to a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers, the first United Nations response to the war.

The 193-member world body adopted the resolution by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions after rejecting a Canadian amendment backed by the United States. It would have unequivocally condemned the Oct. 7 “terrorist attacks” by Hamas and demanded the immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas, which is not mentioned in the Arab-drafted resolution.

Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, called the General Assembly “more courageous, more principled” than the divided U.N. Security Council, which failed in four attempts during the past two weeks to reach agreement on a resolution. Two were vetoed and two failed to get the minimum nine “yes” votes required for approval.

Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called it “a day that will go down in infamy,” saying after the vote: “Israel will not stop the operation until Hamas terror capabilities are destroyed and our hostages are returned. … And the only way to destroy Hamas is root them out of their tunnels and subterranean city of terror.”

Frustrated Arab nations went to the General Assembly, where there are no vetoes — just as Ukraine did after Russia’s February 2022 invasion because of Moscow’s Security Council veto power — to press for a U.N. response. And the United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the Arab representative on the Security Council, expressed delight at the result.

“120 votes in this kind of geopolitical environment is a very, very high signal of the support for international law, for proportionate use of force, and it is a rejection of the status quo that is currently happening on the ground,” she said.

The 14 countries that voted against the resolution include Israel and its closest ally, the United States, five Pacific island nations and four European countries — Austria, Croatia, Czechia and Hungary, all European Union members. Eight EU members voted in favor.

France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere said his country supported the resolution “because nothing could justify the suffering of civilians,” and he urged collective efforts to establish a humanitarian truce.

Mansour said the European votes indicate they can be “very helpful” in pursuing a Security Council resolution “or in maximizing pressure in Israel to stop this war.”

While the surprise Hamas attacks killed some 1,400 Israelis, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The escalating death toll and destruction in Gaza heightened international support for “humanitarian truces” to get desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel to the 2.3 million people in Gaza.

Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but the UAE’s Nusseibeh told reporters “they carry incredible weight and moral authority.”

She said the 10 elected Security Council members, who serve two-year terms, will take the “moral authority” from the General Assembly and try to break the gridlock on a council resolution.

-The votes came part way through a list of 113 speakers at an emergency special session of the General Assembly on Israeli actions in occupied Palestinian territories.

Jordan’s U.N. Ambassador Mahmoud Hmoud, speaking on behalf of the U.N.’s 22-nation Arab group, called for action on the resolution because of the urgency of the escalating situation on the ground.

Before the vote, Hmoud urged defeat of the Canadian amendment, saying “Israel is responsible for the atrocities that are being committed now, and that will be committed in the ground invasion of Gaza.”

Canada’s U.N. Ambassador Robert Rae countered that the resolution appears to forget that the events of Oct. 7 happened. The amendment would condemn Hamas, “which is responsible for one of the worst terrorist attacks in history,” he said.

Pakistan’s U.N. Ambassador Munir Akram drew loud applause when he said the Arab-drafted resolution deliberately didn’t condemn or mention Israel or name any other party. “If Canada was really equitable,” Akram said, “it would agree either to name everybody — both sides who are guilty of having committed crimes — or it would not name either as we chose.”

The vote on the Canadian amendment was 88-55 with 23 abstentions, but it failed to get a two-thirds majority of those voting for or against — abstentions didn’t count. In the vote on the entire resolution that followed, Canada abstained.

The assembly’s emergency special session, which began Wednesday, continued Friday morning with U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield echoing Israel’s Erdan in calling the resolution “outrageous” for never mentioning Hamas and saying it is “detrimental” to the vision of a two-state solution.

She called it “a perilous moment for Israelis and Palestinians,” stressing that there is no justification for Hamas “terror,” that Palestinians are being used as human shields and that “the lives of innocent Palestinians must be protected.”

Oman, speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemned Israel’s “siege” of Gaza, starvation of its population and collective punishment of Palestinians. But it said the Palestinians won’t be deterred from demanding their “legitimate inalienable rights, chief among them the right to self- determination and the right to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.”

In addition to calling for “an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities,” the resolution adopted Friday demands that all parties immediately comply with their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law requiring protection of civilians and the schools, hospitals and other infrastructure critical for their survival.

The resolution demands that essential supplies be allowed into the Gaza Strip and humanitarian workers have sustained access. And it calls on Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to evacuate the north and move to the south and “firmly rejects any attempts at the forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population.”

The resolution also stresses the need “to urgently establish a mechanism to ensure the protection of the Palestinian civilian population.”

And it “emphasizes the importance of preventing further destabilization and escalation of violence in the region” and calls on all parties to exercise “maximum restraint” and on all those with influence to press them “to work toward this objective.”"," of the current conflict began with a “barbaric” and “unprovoked” attack on Israel.The U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution calling for a ""humanitarian truce"" in the conflict between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers, with 120 countries voting in favor and 14 against. The resolution was the first U.N. response to the war and was supported by eight EU members and rejected by four. Jordan's U.N. Ambassador Mahmoud Hmoud said the resolution was necessary due to the urgency of the escalating situation."

GREENWICH — Control of the Board of Estimate and Taxation, arguably the most powerful government body in Greenwich, is on the ballot this year.

The BET sets the town’s budget each spring. It also approves funding requests throughout the year and the political party that controls the board has the ability to shut down projects by withholding their support.

The BET has 12 members, six Democrats and six Republicans. All 12 seats are open this year, but there are only 12 people running, so they will all get a spot. But the BET election is important because the party that wins more votes gets to pick the chair of the board, a position that comes with the power to break ties when the board splits 6-6.

Republicans have dominated the BET for the past century. They only lost control in one cycle, in 2017, but won it back in 2019 and have held it ever since.

“For the past 100 years, Republicans (in) leadership in the BET have helped create one of the most desirable communities in the country if not the world,” Republican candidate Karen Fassuliotis wrote in response to a candidate questionnaire.

But Democrats say this isn't the case. “The current single-year budget focus has resulted in millions of dollars of higher project costs, delayed implementation of needed facilities, and greater risk to the town,” wrote Democratic incumbent Leslie Moriarty.

Politics have become nasty in Greenwich and partisan sniping has been commonplace at BET meetings this year, particularly around questions of funding building projects at Central Middle School and Old Greenwich School.

In prior years, when partisanship on the board was less fierce, the tie-breaking vote was deployed sparingly. But now, it is used at almost every meeting of the BET, including dozens of times during the budget making process in April.

The six Republicans running for the board now — incumbents Nisha Arora, Fassuliotis, Harry Fisher and Leslie Tarkington plus newcomers David Alfano and Lucia Jansen — are generally arguing that the BET has functioned well over the past century and that they will continue to guard against tax hikes and overspending.

“Our funding approach using cash and short-term borrowing (has) resulted in the town having the highest ratings and financial standards for municipalities in the country and has made Greenwich the envy of the rest of the state,"" Fassuliotis wrote.

Republicans said electing them will ensure that Democrats cannot raise taxes.

“Fiscal discipline is under attack by partisan Democrats,” Arora wrote. “Despite passing the largest capital budget ($112 million) in the town’s history, Democrats are arguing this is not enough. Democrats want to spend more, and Democratic BET members are running on a platform to take on long-term debt, raise taxes, and spend without constraints.”

Democrats said this line of attack is baseless, as they too live in town and care about keeping taxes affordable, while still funding the town’s needs. Democrats running for the BET are incumbents Moriarty, Stephen Selbst and David Weisbrod, plus newcomers Elliot Alchek, Matt DesChamps and Scott Kalb.

“These investments can be made with minimal impact, if any, on tax rates,"" Moriarty said. ""And it is not just about cost. Greenwich’s reputation as the premier location in Fairfield County for young families has taken a hit with the lack of commitment to fix our aging and non-compliant school facilities.”

Some of the biggest political fighting in town this year has centered around school spending, particularly the fact that Republicans on the BET have not supported allocating construction funds. Republicans have said these projects are not ready, while Democrats argued that their funding is long overdue.

The BET split 6-6 on funding $39 million for Old Greenwich School repairs on Oct. 17, with all Republicans opposed. Without majority support, this request failed.

The BET voted to approve $42 million in additional construction funds for Central Middle School on Oct. 24, with all Democrats and two outgoing Republicans voting for the funding.

None of the four incumbent Republicans running for the BET voted to fund CMS last week. Arora, Fisher and Tarkington abstained and Fassuliotis voted against it.

Kalb, one of the incoming Democratic candidates who has extensive experience in finance, said Republicans have a “terrible track record” running the BET.

“In the real world, if you had a financing team that wasted millions of dollars on frivolous lawsuits, delayed spending on needed infrastructure driving-up costs, increased health and safety risks while decreasing services, turned down millions of dollars of grant money, ignored the advice of experts and the concerns of children and parents, lurched from short-term crisis to short-term crisis while failing to plan for the long-term, they would be fired.”

The election is on Nov. 7.","This year, in Greenwich, Connecticut, 12 seats on the Board of Estimate and Taxation (BET) are open and up for grabs in the election. Whoever wins the most votes will gain control and be able to break ties when the board splits 6-6. Republicans have held control for the past century and are arguing for fiscal discipline, while Democrats insist that the town needs to invest in aging and non-compliant school facilities."

People view retirement as the ultimate reward for decades of hard work. Many look forward to the day they can say goodbye to the monotony of the daily punch clock and finally kick back to enjoy the precious golden years. However, those who study retirement closely will find no one-size-fits-all strategy on how and when to retire. Moreover, savvy individuals are rethinking the traditional retirement age by delaying retirement for various reasons.

Contrary to convention, retiring later can be a wise financial decision. Late or delayed retirement can come with its benefits. It can also be a practical decision based on one’s financial circumstances. Whether you’re nearing retirement age or at the peak of your career, it helps to consider the advantages of postponing your retirement plan by a few years.

Is delaying retirement a smart move?

Pushing back retirement is an unconventional choice, yet it is one that more and more people are beginning to make. The average retirement age in the US is 65 for men and 63 for women.

The transforming economic landscape and changing demographics wherein populations are aging and living longer contribute to the changing retirement timeline. The following are the top reasons to delay retirement:

1. Adding to retirement savings

By delaying retirement for several years, you can boost your nest egg strategically. You can contribute to 401(k)s, IRAs, or pension plans by working a few additional years.

To boost your savings, you can make the most of employer-matching contributions. In the US, some employers match a percentage of retirement account contributions. Hence, you can accumulate these matching funds by staying longer in the workforce.

For instance, let’s assume a scenario wherein your employer matches a maximum of 50% of the first 6% of your annual salary that you contribute to your 401(k). With a $100,000 yearly salary and a contribution of 6%, your contribution would be $6000. Thus, 50% of $6000 would be $3000—your employer’s match. Your total contribution would then be $9000 per year. A 3% salary contribution matched at 50% or $1500 would yield a total of $4500 in contributions.

Furthermore, past age 50, you become eligible for catch-up contributions to your retirement accounts. Additional contributions to your 401(k)s and IRAs can significantly bolster your retirement savings. As of 2023, individual workers can contribute up to $22,500 to their 401(k) plans—this amount is up from the maximum limit of $20,500 in 2022.

In addition, the income ranges that determine your eligibility for deductible contributions to Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs, and for claiming the Saver’s Credit will all be adjusted for 2023. All eligible income ranges will increase.

All taxpayers need to know all the IRA and 401(k) limit increases in 2023, including the following key points:

Catch-up contributions limits

An increase in the catch-up contributions for employees age 50 and above participating in SIMPLE plans will be adjusted from $3000 to $3500. Also, the catch-up contribution limit for those of the same age bracket participating in most 457 plans, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and the Thrift Savings Plan of the US federal government will increase to $7500.

Increase in IRA annual contributions limits

For IRAs, the annual contributions limit will be increased to $6500. However, the IRA catch-up contribution limit or max for those aged 50 and over remains at $1,000 and is not subject to a cost-of-living adjustment.

Also, you may live longer than you think. A 65-year-old man today has a 50 percent probability of living past 85. Sixty-five-year-old couples may be surprised to know that there is a 50% chance that one of them lives past 92. With your golden years possibly extended, there’s more motivation to accumulate as much savings as possible before you retire.

2. Extending the time horizon for investing

Savvy investors delay retirement to take advantage of the investing time horizon. Not cashing out on investments immediately allows them to grow for a few more years.

For example, a diversified portfolio with a 7% annual return delayed by five years could produce an additional 35%. The projection assumes, however, that the market performs consistently. This strategy offers a practical advantage to grow your portfolio passively.

By delaying retirement, you can benefit from compound interest. The longer your money is invested, the more time it has to grow and generate exponential returns from your principal and previous earnings.

Choosing a longer time horizon also allows you to strategize your investments to allow for aggressive growth properly. Longer time horizons will also enable you to take more risks and allocate a portion of the portfolio to high-growth assets. This extension can increase your wealth substantially over time. Moreover, you can weather market downturns much more easily than those with shorter investment periods.

3. Accumulating Social Security benefits

You can boost Social Security benefits by delaying retirement a few years. The computation for Social Security benefits in the US is based on the highest 35 years of earnings. The benefits increase every year you postpone retirement until the absolute age limit.

You need ten years of work or 40 work credits to qualify for Social Security. To be eligible for the maximum benefit, you need a record of earning Social Security’s total taxable income for 35 years. In 2023, the earnings cap subject to Social Security tax is $160,200, up from 2022’s limit of $147,000.

How to get the maximum Social Security benefit

There are steps to optimize Social Security benefits. First, you must earn the maximum taxable wage, as stated above. Social Security will take your 35 best-paid years adjusted for inflation. It then averages those years together to compute your benefits. To make the most out of your Social Security benefits, you must contribute the maximum allowable amount. The max is adjusted periodically based on the US national average wage index across the time frame.

Next, you need to choose to start receiving your Social Security benefits later—at age 70. While it’s possible to begin accessing your benefits by age 62, postponing the receipt of these benefits till 70 will ensure that you get the maximum monthly amount when you retire.

4. Holding on longer to employer benefits

As employees, some would-be retirees enjoy valuable benefits from their respective employers. Such benefits include life insurance, healthcare coverage, and retirement plan access. Delaying retirement lets employees enjoy these perks longer. The benefits offered by an employer can save you thousands of dollars and even provide valuable financial support in health emergencies.

When you extend your employer-sponsored health insurance, you enjoy better coverage and lower premiums. This scenario is better than having an individual plan or Medicare, saving you thousands of dollars annually.

In addition, if your employer provides you with life insurance coverage, you can keep this coverage and avoid expensive premiums in retirement.

5. Buffering financial security

Financial security is a growing concern among would-be retirees and those already retired. When they’re out of a regular job, many feel less secure about their finances. By delaying retirement, you can add to your savings and contribute to Social Security for longer—thus increasing benefits and reducing the probability of outliving your retirement funds.

The latest Retirement Confidence Survey or RCS conducted by the EBRI or Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald Research reports that workers’ and retirees’ confidence in their ability to finance their retirement has significantly dropped in 2023.

Some of the reasons behind this plummeting confidence in retirement security include today’s uncertain economic climate, fueled by the threat of unchecked inflation, and some prevailing effects of the pandemic. Economic concerns are eroding Americans’ confidence in their retirement preparations.

The survey of 2,537 Americans was conducted between January 5 and February 2, 2023. Respondents were of working age or older. They were worried their salaries would be increasingly unable to keep up with inflation. Retirees worry about the cost of living and future expenses. The cost-of-living crisis has been setting alarms everywhere, including the US.

Furthermore, 50 percent of retirees reported higher overall spending than expected. This figure represents an increase over last year’s figure of 30%. Among other key findings in the survey are the worsening of debt problems among workers, decreasing retirement accounts with retirement savings taking a hit over the last twelve months.

It also highlighted a lack of understanding of retirement plan investment options and the respondents’ preference for income stability in retirement over the prospect of growth in investments.

6. Delaying Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

Those with tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s, or traditional IRAs must start taking distributions by age 72. Extending your years of work will allow you to delay the distributions, which may reduce liability.

For example, someone with a substantial IRA and a higher tax bracket can save up to thousands of dollars yearly if they delay their RMDs.

7. Achieving financial freedom by paying off debt

Many of today’s would-be retirees still carry debt. Working for additional years allows one to pay off some or all outstanding debt. Such debt can come from credit card balances, loans, or mortgages.

Retirees can free up retirement income for other purposes, including leisure, when debt is eliminated or reduced. Moreover, being debt-free before retirement significantly reduces financial stress. You can enjoy your golden years without the burden of monthly debt payments.

When you delay retirement to reduce or eliminate debt, prioritize high-interest debt. Examples of high-interest debts are credit cards and personal loans. When you pay off such obligations, you free up more income for savings and investments.

You can also use the delayed retirement years to accelerate your mortgage payments. It’s crucial to reduce the principal on your loan and thus shorten your mortgage term. Paying off your mortgage early could potentially save you tens of thousands in interest.

8. Pursuing passion projects

Delaying retirement doesn’t mean you must stay in the same job you’ve had for decades. You can stay in the workforce but in a new company, project, or career that makes you more fulfilled.

You can pursue practical careers that offer a steady income without much of the rat race associated with your youth. You can be an independent accountant, become a notary, or start a fresh career as a consultant in your field.

You can also pursue passion projects that weren’t feasible earlier in life when you were still starting out, like starting a business.

Many successful entrepreneurs started their businesses in their forties or later. Middle age can be a catalyst for business success. You combine the wealth of your experience with some financial security accumulated from your savings. You can follow your passions and leverage decades of expertise.

The public often gets caught up in the myth of the young Silicon Valley startup founder. Reality is much more grounded. On average, the most successful US startups—those in the top echelons of growth—were launched by founders aged 45. Thus, it’s twice more likely for a 50-year-old entrepreneur to establish a highly successful startup than a younger rival. Pre-retirement passion projects can be a source of financial success and personal accomplishment.

Staying in the workforce or business longer isn’t always about the money. It can be an opportunity to establish a legacy and devote more time to community and public causes. You can also work longer and use the additional savings to establish philanthropic projects.

If one of your lifetime goals was to establish a local scholarship fund or donate to a favored charity, delayed retirement can allow you to add to the financial capability required to contribute to your legacy.

9. Promoting health and wellness

For some people, an abrupt halt to mental and physical activity and the social interactions they’re used to at work can adversely affect their psychological and physical health. Engaging in daily social interactions and meaningful activities contributes to overall well-being.

For many retirees, part-time work and volunteerism contribute to their general wellness. Furthermore, research shows that continued engagement with meaningful work in late retirement is associated with better cognitive faculties and physical functioning among older adults.

10. Waiting out inflation

Today’s inflation rates are concerning. If you are concerned about retirement preparedness, it may make sense to wait out the current scenario of rising prices and ensure you are on more stable footing before retiring. If you are unprepared to face the rising cost of living uncertainties, it’s better to stay in the workforce longer and observe whether circumstances will improve in the coming years.

Late Retirement: A Power Move To Maximize Financial Potential

In a world where traditional retirement concepts are being transformed, more individuals are discovering that delaying retirement can be an astute financial move with the right strategies. Moving retirement by several years allows you to accumulate more cash and assets and compound your investments.

In summary, you can use retirement to boost your nest egg by maximizing retirement contributions, optimizing Social Security benefits, paying off debt, extending your investment horizon, keeping your employer benefits, strategically delaying RMDs, and pursuing new and engaging passion projects that could be income-generating. The time between your peak working years and retirement could be a golden horizon where you supercharge your wealth while creating opportunities for self-discovery.

Instead of seeing it as a mere transition period, use late retirement as a power move to craft a new beginning—financially secure and emotionally fulfilled.

Windows Phone got its revenge against YouTube, Microsoft's CEO admitted it was a mistake to end Windows Phone, and Qualcomm unveiled a processor that could revolutionize Windows computing. On top of that, Microsoft leadership discussed features that we'll see in Windows 12.

Windows Phone gets revenge on YouTube

(Image credit: Daniel Rubino)

Windows Phone is dead, but it's the Halloween season so some haunting from a dead mobile ecosystem feels appropriate. Windows Phone always had a mixed history with YouTube. Google sabotaged Windows Phone in many ways including an arbitrary block of the YouTube app for Windows Phone made by Microsoft.

Well, the joke is on Google, as setting your browser's user-agent to Windows Phone will bypass Google's anti-ad-block features. See Google, Windows Phone really is king.

Will Google block this workaround? The company certainly could. But considering uBlock Origin still works and is much more popular than switching a user agent string to Windows Phone, there's a good chance Google won't do anything to block Windows Phone's revenge. There's also a chance that Google has forgotten about Windows Phone. Everyone else has.

Nadella admits Windows Phone mistake

Two Windows Phone stories in one week?! What is this, 2013? Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat down with Mathias Dpfner at Axel Springer's Berlin headquarters. There, the Microsoft executive talked about a variety of topics, including OpenAI, Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard, and more. But one topic stuck out, at least to us. Nadella admitted that killing of Windows Phone was a mistake. Microsoft leaders have said as much before, but it's always nice to hear.

""The decision I think a lot of people talk about — and one of the most difficult decisions I made when I became CEO — was our exit of what I'll call the mobile phone as defined then,"" said Nadella.

""In retrospect, I think there could have been ways we could have made it work by perhaps reinventing the category of computing between PCs, tablets, and phones.""

I'd like to remind Nadella that Microsoft tried to reinvent the category of computing between PCs, tablets, and phones with the Surface Duo. The company then failed to update the device and abandoned it. Time is a flat circle.

Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite

After months of teasing and reports, Qualcomm finally announced its Snapdragon X Elite processor. If the chip lives up to Qualcomm's promises and the immense hype that it's garnered, Windows 11 on ARM PCs will have an excellent 2024.

Qualcomm claims that the Snapdragon X Elite has better single-threaded scores than Apple's M2 Max and Intel's Core i9-13980HX, all while using 30% to 70% less power, respectively.

The Snapdragon X Elite is the result of Qualcomm's Nuvia acquisition. Former Apple engineers founded Nuvia and have been hard at work on the new processor for Qualcomm. The chip is built on a 4nm process, has 12 cores, and hits up to 3.8GHz on single and dual-core and has a boost speed of up to 4.3GHz. The Adreno GPU that accompanies the Snapdragon X Elite can handle up to 4.6 TFLOPs.

Our Editor-in-Chief Daniel Rubino was at Snapdragon Summit to see the new chip unveiled. Rubino also sat down with Qualcomm's Keder Kondap to chat about the Snapdragon X Elite.

The Snapdragon X Elite wasn't the only Windows on ARM news this week. Blackmagic Design announced that DaVinci Resolve, a popular video editing tool for professionals and casual creators, will soon natively support PCs running Qualcomm's Snapdragon Elite X platform.

Microsoft also spoke at Snapdragon Summit, but that's worth a section of its own.

Microsoft teases Windows 12 features

Microsoft had two executives appear on stage during Snapdragon Summit. CEO Satya Nadella and CVP Windows + Devices Pavan Davuluri discussed the future of Windows, the Snapdragon X Elite, and NPUs. While neither specifically mentioned Windows 12, both executives talked about features that will be in the next version of Windows.

Nadella focused on AI integration with Windows and emphasized the importance of Copilot going forward. Microsoft has a form of Copilot available across several apps and services, including Windows 11.

Hybrid computing was also a focus of Nadella. In the future we'll likely see PCs share the processing workload through the cloud. For example, a PC would process some functions locally and offload more intensive workloads to a more powerful system.

2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,How a new home in Utah aims to help heal sex trafficking ... - Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/home-utah-aims-help-heal-003657517.html,"Brandy Funk, left, and Brittney Garcia, survivors of human trafficking and members of the Aspen Magdalene board, talk about the house and their experiences at the future property for the Aspen Magdalene House, Utah’s first home to provide shelter, therapy and case management for human trafficking survivors, in Salt Lake County on Friday, Oct. 27, 2023. | Megan Nielsen, Deseret News

Brittney Garcia thought she’d met the man of her dreams — and for a while he was. He did everything for her and she soon fell deeply in love. Then things started to change. He introduced her to drugs. That made it easier when he began sex trafficking her.

Garcia, 44, clawed her way out of that life nine years ago with the help of law enforcement and others, after two years of being trapped by fear of what her trafficker would do if she tried to walk away.

Her younger sister, Brandy Funk, 42, has a story that is remarkably similar, though she got free differently from the man she once trusted and loved by going to one of the few places she was allowed to go unaccompanied. Once there, she contacted domestic violence experts and was whisked away to safety eight years ago.

Friday, the two sat on the couch in the family room of a spacious home in Salt Lake County, looked squarely into television and still cameras, and talked about the hope they believe that home will soon offer other women who’ve been trafficked.

Though funds are still being raised to make it a reality, Aspen Magdalene House is in the near-culmination stage of five years of planning by a group of dedicated Utahns who want to provide shelter, therapy and case management to sex trafficking survivors. The women who will be able to stay there for up to two years will go through trauma-based therapy, life skills training, financial planning and receive other services like preemployment coaching to help them rebuild their lives.

Perhaps as important, they will have a sisterhood of fellow survivors who understand and can support them as they move forward, said Terry Palmer, co-chair of the Aspen House SLC board that’s been working to make the home a reality.

The Aspen House Board of Directors includes community activist Pamela Atkinson, a community activist and advisor to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Utah Rep. Sandra Hollins, sex trafficking survivors including Funk and Garcia, as well as community and industry leaders and other advocates for exploited women.

In the five years since they started working on the issue, the board and supporters have created a leadership and governing structure, raised community awareness and some money — the capital campaign is very much ongoing — crafted a business plan and launched a survivor support group, along with other programming. They’ve involved local groups willing to provide services and guidance. And they found the house, which they plan to close on at the end of January if they can raise the rest of the cash.

A model program

The need is not theoretical. Utah is in the top 10 per capita for calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, according to data provided by the board. In background material, the group quotes law enforcement officials, who note that recent trafficking arrests are “the tip of the iceberg” of the problem in Utah.

According to officials, human trafficking is second only to the drug trade in criminal activity — a $150 billion industry worldwide “that uses force, fraud and coercion to sexually exploit individuals.”

Aspen Magdalene House is patterned after the Thistle Farms model, which includes 57 established houses nationwide and 35 in various planning or startup stages, including Utah’s. Thistle Farms boasts a 75% success rate helping women who have been exploited reclaim their lives and financial independence.

During an open house Friday, board members — including Funk and Garcia, who also serve on the board — talked about the devastation wrought by sex trafficking, including personal trauma, addiction, legal woes, mental illness and barriers that make it hard to escape, to find housing and to get jobs.

“Sisterhood and bonding” are really crucial, Palmer said. She noted that women who have been trafficked often feel judged. Most often, challenges sometimes going back many years made them vulnerable to being trafficked initially, including adverse childhood events like abuse or neglect and substance use issues, among others. So there can be layers of trauma involved.

Though the individuals and issues they each have faced are different, the sisterhood understands that, said Palmer.

Among the greatest gifts the haven will provide, Atkinson told Deseret News, are love and acceptance. She said that survivors sometimes are sent to homeless shelters, where they are bullied. They may face that in other situations, too. Harsh judgments don’t promote healing.

“We can restore their self-esteem,” said Atkinson. “Love and acceptance are two of the greatest things we can do.”

The efforts are backed by local businesses and experts the board calls benevolent partners who have agreed to provide services:

A helping hand

Garcia will serve as a resident manager when the house formally opens. Initially, there will be room for seven women, but as it gears up, the number is expected to double. It’s a good start on changing trajectories, but the need is far greater.

Asked what she’d like people to know about the challenges she’d faced and about trafficking, Garcia said people need to realize “it can happen to anyone: your sister, your best friend, your neighbor’s kid.”

She and Palmer both said people may think of kidnapped children trafficked for sex when the topic arises, but those are not the usual victims. Most who are trafficked are preyed upon by people they know, sometimes even family. And something in their lifetime experiences to that point makes them vulnerable.

America First Patriots are getting aggregated, curated, and original content every day from Discern Report.

Geopolitical instability in the Middle East unquestionably triggered a surge in the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, causing prices to rebound from their seven-month lows. Nevertheless, another significant factor is currently exerting its influence on the market and helping to maintain gold’s value at the $2,000 per ounce mark, as per insights shared by Ryan McIntyre, Managing Partner at Sprott Inc, in an interview with Kitco News.

McIntyre’s optimistic outlook for gold comes amidst the metal’s resilience, holding its ground and staying above the $1,950 per ounce threshold. This resilience is particularly noteworthy given that bond yields have approached 5%, marking their highest level in 16 years.

According to McIntyre, the breakdown of gold’s historical negative correlation with bond yields is occurring due to mounting concerns about the fiscal situation of the U.S. government and its ever-increasing debt, which has now surpassed a staggering $33 trillion.

However, it’s not merely the size of the U.S. government’s debt that has McIntyre worried. He emphasizes, “The most concerning aspect for me is the deficit. I’m more focused on the trajectory of where things are headed. The rising deficit indicates that the U.S. is failing to get its financial house in order.”

Additionally, McIntyre points out that the elevated gold prices reflect the growing risk of the U.S. economy falling into a potential debt spiral, driven by higher interest rates leading to increased borrowing costs, which, in turn, necessitate more capital.

He draws parallels with a situation from last October when the U.K. bond market experienced turmoil after then-Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss proposed substantial tax cuts, financed through higher deficits. The financial market upheaval eventually cost Truss her position as Prime Minister.

The growing focus on the U.S.’ escalating debt is, in part, a consequence of the rapid increase in interest rates. With the Fed Funds rates ranging between 5.25% and 5.50%, the U.S. government is now allocating more funds to service its $33 trillion debt than it allocates to national defense.

Simultaneously, McIntyre highlights that, along with the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, it has significantly reduced its balance sheet, leading to a substantial decline in the M2 money supply—essentially, the money held by the public.

“As the money supply shrinks, asset values inherently decline. To meet credit requirements at higher levels, you now need more assets. This is a precarious situation, and that’s why investors are turning to gold as a stable asset. If you don’t want to rely solely on U.S. government bonds, gold is the one safe-haven asset,” McIntyre explains.

While the Federal Reserve’s primary focus remains on controlling inflation, McIntyre contends that they should also be mindful of the risk that bond yields might detach from monetary policy.

Though it might be a bit premature, McIntyre envisions a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains its hawkish stance but starts purchasing bonds to keep yields in check. Additionally, increasing the M2 money supply could help alleviate market tensions.

However, he acknowledges the Fed’s dilemma, as aggressive actions to address rising deficits could lead to concerns about an overly expanded balance sheet. “In the short term, it might achieve the desired effect, but it’s likely to make people more apprehensive. This is the challenge when control starts slipping away,” McIntyre notes.

Given this environment of uncertainty, McIntyre anticipates that gold will continue to perform well and remain in an upward trend until the government can rein in its spending—an eventuality that doesn’t appear likely in the near future.

It took a jury about 90 minutes to reach the verdict for 43-year-old Candice Jones.

On Jan. 18, 2018, Naperville police responded to Whispering Hills Drive for a report of a missing man, identified as 20-year-old Michael Armendariz, who was last seen around 9:30 p.m. on Jan. 14.

Prosecutors say Armendariz received a Snapchat message from one of Jones' co-defendants, 26-year-old Cassanda Green, of Rockford, at about 9:11 p.m. on Jan. 14. After receiving that message, it's alleged that Armendariz left his apartment and got into a vehicle driven by Green. Five minutes later, prosecutors say 27-year-old Ernest Collins came out of hiding in the back of the vehicle and shot Armendariz twice in the back of the head.

Collins and Green then took Armendariz's body to Chicago where they stuffed it in a garbage can and placed the bin in Collins' mother's garage, prosecutors said. Collins' mother is Jones.

Then, at some point, the garbage can was moved to the garage of a vacant home next to Jones' home.

According to prosecutors, Collins and Green also took Armendariz's apartment keys and burglarized his home the day after the murder.

Armendariz's body was discovered in the vacant garage several months later.

A month after the murder, all three suspects were taken into custody.

Ernest Collins, his girlfriend Cassandra Green and his mother Candice Jones are accused of the murder of Michael Armendariz, whose body was found in a garbage can in Chicago.

""This evening, a jury found Candice Jones, the last of three defendants charged in the murder of Michael Armendariz, guilty of first-degree murder,"" DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said.

""Guilty verdicts, however, cannot bring Michael back to those who loved him. The diabolical plot devised by Candice Jones, Ernest Collins and Cassandra Green, and the execution of that plot, left a void in the lives of Michael’s surviving family and friends that will never be filled. I wish them strength as they continue their lives, having replaced Michael’s presence with just his memory

Grand hotel, shows a cut in his mouth. Guardado is among four people who allege a security guard assaulted them while they were picketing outside the hotel Friday morning. (Suhauna Hussain / Los Angeles Times)

Striking hotel workers allege they were assaulted by a security guard while picketing outside L.A. Grand Hotel on Friday morning.

Three L.A. Grand employees and one organizer with Unite Here Local 11, the union representing the striking employees, were injured in the altercation.

As striking employees marched down the hotel's driveway, a security guard started yelling expletives at one of the workers, said Julio Lopez, 44, a Unite Here Local 11 organizer. Workers reported the incident to a supervisor, who called the guard inside.

Lopez and two workers said in interviews that the guard emerged from the hotel lobby shortly after. He approached picketers again, speaking aggressively. He punched one worker in the face and shoved Lopez, who said he fell to the ground and injured his knee. The guard then ran toward another worker, Rebeca Becerra, slapped her face, and dealt a blow to another worker nearby who tried to help, they said.

Becerra, 64, who has worked as a housekeeper at L.A. Grand for 26 years, said she felt dazed and nauseous, and tried not to fall.

""I didn't even notice there was blood on my face until my co-worker told me I was bleeding,"" Becerra said, pointing to her nose.

At that point, the guard began rummaging in his car, which was parked partially in the driveway, workers said.

""I was scared — I thought he might have a gun,"" said Cristobal Guardado, 63, who was hit when he tried to help Becerra, sustaining a cut to his lip. ""That's what was going through my mind.""

Police and paramedics arrived about 30 minutes after the altercation, he said. Guardado said he didn't feel well afterward; he said this type of stress has affected his health in recent years, ever since his son was killed by a former L.A. County sheriff's deputy in 2020. Guardado, a cook at the L.A. Grand for about 35 years, said that when paramedics checked him, they told him his blood pressure was very high.

The downtown hotel is crucial to the mayor’s Inside Safe program, which seeks to dismantle homeless encampments and bring people indoors. The hotel has provided about 480 rooms for the city’s unhoused population since the outbreak of COVID-19.

The security guard involved in the incident was hired not by the hotel but by Weingart Center Assn., the nonprofit that provides case management services at L.A. Grand, said Russ Cox, a representative for Shenzhen New World I, the Chinese company that owns L.A. Grand.

""Strikers were blowing horns in face, he asked them to step back, and he lost his temper,"" Cox said, according to an account of the incident relayed to him. ""He shouldn’t have done that.""

The Weingart Center did not respond to a request for comment.

Security guards posted outside the hotel on Friday affiliated with United Private Security, a company based in Riverside, declined to comment.

Thousands of cooks, housekeepers, dishwashers, servers, porters and front desk agents at some 60 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties have been conducting intermittent strikes for nearly four months.

The alleged assault at the L.A. Grand is not the first time striking workers represented by Unite Here Local 11 have experienced violence and other tensions on the picket line. Angry guests have filed noise complaints about early morning protests. There were instances in which a passerby threw an egg and poured a cup of urine on workers.

In the summer, the union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board highlighting what it called a pattern of violent incidents and property destruction at picket lines by hotel security personnel and guests. The complaint listed three hotels it has now asked people to boycott — Hotel Maya, Fairmont Miramar in Santa Monica and Laguna Cliffs Marriott Resort & Spa in Dana Point.

The Friday altercation at L.A. Grand came just two days after picketers were hit by a car in driveway of the same hotel around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, workers said. That day, employees at L.A. Grand and dozens of other hotels across L.A. and Orange counties had launched a new wave of strikes.

L.A. Grand housekeeper Ana L. Pineda, 64, who was hit, said in an interview the car's driver was also a security guard. Pineda said the hit seemed intentional, with the guard swerving toward her. She said her hip, elbow and shoulder were bruised and felt inflamed because of the altercation.

Officer Drake Madison confirmed reports were filed with the Los Angeles Police Department regarding both incidents. A report of a battery involving four victims and a security guard suspect was filed Friday. Injuries did not appear to be major, Madison said. He said the information was preliminary and detectives would investigate the incidents.

Friday afternoon, several hours after the alleged assault, a mariachi band played as striking workers took a break from marching outside the hotel to eat lunch. They loaded carne asada and rice and beans onto their plates and munched on slices of watermelon at tables set up under a canopy. A banner hanging from the canopy read, ""L.A. Grand workers on strike.""

The driver of the stopped car, Luis Hernandez-Ramos, 33, and passenger, Douglas Mancias-Martinez, 27, were stopped Oct. 14 on Ohio 4 in the city of Monroe by Butler County Sheriff's deputies. They both had Mexican driver's licenses, provided conflicting stories and displayed ""nervous behavior,"" which led to a K-9 vehicle search, Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones said.

They appeared for their preliminary hearings Wednesday before Area II Court Judge Kevin McDonnough, who found enough evidence to bound their cases over.

The K-9 alerted and resulted in the seizure of three kilos of fentanyl in vacuum-sealed packages with a street value of $500,000. The driver and passenger were arrested and booked into the Butler County Jail for possession of drugs and trafficking in drugs, first-degree felonies.

Even if you own one of the best washing machines , we tend to be uneasy when it comes to cleaning sneakers. We worry that we could damage them in the process, particularly where the washing machine is involved. The trouble is, a damp cloth alone is not likely to cut it when removing stains from sneakers. From caked on dirt to mystery scuffs, all kinds of marks will appear here.

What you'll need Scrubbing brush Dish soap Laundry detergent Toothbrush Microfiber cloth Mesh laundry bag

Luckily, there are ways to thoroughly clean sneakers, without damaging them. Here, we will take you through the best methods and products you can use, whether you’d prefer to use the washing machine or stick to washing by hand. We will also provide tips on how to remove stubborn odors as well as protect your sneakers from stains in the future. By the time you’re finished, your sneakers will gleam as good as new again.

Dealing with canvas, leather, or mesh white shoes? Here’s how to clean white shoes and get them looking like new again.

How to clean sneakers by hand

1. Brush off excess dirt

First, brush off any excess dirt or debris on your sneakers with a small scrub brush. Ensure any clumps of mud, grass or dirt are removed before cleaning. It’s best to do this over a trashcan or outside to keep your floor mess-free.

2. Remove shoelaces

If you laces are grimy, remove the shoelaces to wash. You can either wash by hand with warm soapy water to remove dirt, or machine-wash on a cold, gentle cycle in a mesh bag. Avoid putting them through the dryer as this can melt the plastic ends. Instead, leave them to air dry.

If they are fraying however, it’s probably time to replace them with new laces. Just be sure to measure your existing ones to check the correct length before buying.

3. Create a soapy cleaning mixture

Then, mix warm water with 1 to 2 tablespoons of laundry detergent in a large bucket, sink, or tub that is wide enough to submerge your sneakers. Dip an old toothbrush or small brush in the water and scrub around the eyelets to remove any dirt or grime. Wipe clean with a damp sponge or cloth. For sneakers with removable insoles, take them out and scrub clean with the soapy water.

4. Scrub the sneakers with a brush

Next, use your brush to scrub your sneakers with the soapy water until all the dirt has been removed. Apply the soapy mixture into the soles with a clean toothbrush. Scrub the soles, taking care to get all the sides and the bottoms of the shoes. For stubborn stains or marks, you may need to repeat this process, or add a few more drops of dish soap to the solution. Once all clean, rinse off the residue well, before allowing your sneakers to air dry completely. Lace them back up if necessary.

How to clean sneakers in the washing machine

1. Check label and brush off dirt

First, check the label of your sneakers to make sure they can be put in the washing machine. Usually, it’s fine to machine-wash canvas and mesh shoes. If so, brush off any excess dirt and debris into the trash can or outside, before putting them in the washing machine.

2. Put sneakers in a mesh laundry bag

Next, place your sneakers inside a mesh laundry bag, to prevent the sneakers from marking up the drum. If your laces are particularly grimy, remove them and put them inside the same laundry bag. You can easily find shoe washing bags like this Vivifying Shoe Washing Bag ($9, Amazon ), to protect them.

Another tip is to wash sneakers alongside towels to prevent the shoes from banging around in the washing machine.

3. Wash on a cool cycle

Next, run a gentle cycle with cool water, using the same amount of detergent as normal. Avoid using hot water as this may damage the sneaker. Never put them through the dryer — always let the sneakers air dry. If you put them in front of any heat source, this may cause plastics to warp or ruin the shape of your favorite sneakers. Also, remove any insoles to dry separately, before wearing again.

How do I get rid of odors in sneakers?

If you have smelly sneakers, the best way to get rid of odors is to sprinkle some baking soda over the insides, and leave overnight. Then, simply shake out the excess baking soda before putting them on the next day. Baking soda has a mild alkaline pH, and is a natural deodorizer and cleaning agent.

If you want to know more about the benefits of baking soda, read our useful guide on what makes baking soda and vinegar so good at cleaning. Just avoid these 7 things you should never clean with baking soda to prevent surface damage.

How to prevent stains on sneakers

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

If you want to prevent stains in the future, there are products you can use. Protective aerosols are widely available which you spray directly onto your sneakers to coat them with an invisible barrier. This protects your sneakers from picking up stains so easily. As a bonus, this solution tends to be waterproof as well, protecting your sneakers from rainfall, and backsplash from puddles.

An example of this type of product would be Crep Protect Shoe Protector Spray ( $15, Amazon ). Just make sure the spray you choose is suitable for your sneaker’s material. Apply your aerosol in a well-ventilated space, and remember that the coating will need to be reapplied every so often — follow your product’s instructions for guidance.

Otherwise, to keep white sneakers looking white, pay attention to the weather forecast before you put them on. If rainfall is likely or has recently fallen, your sneakers can pick up stains quickly, not just from rainfall, but from passing puddles. In such conditions, opt for footwear which is more water-resistant and easier to clean. Consider where you’re planning to go for the day as well — walking around the park is a great day out, but this is much more likely to muddy your sneakers versus walking around the shops. Be selective where and when you wear your sneakers; they will stay cleaner for longer as a consequence."," against each other.This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to clean sneakers, whether by hand or in the washing machine.

With so many new movies landing on Netflix, Max, Peacock and more of the best streaming services, narrowing down the best movies is no small task.

Thankfully, you don't have to. We've curated a list of the nine best movies to check out this weekend, including a mix of old and new that's sure to have something for everyone to watch. Apple TV Plus has a new documentary about Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy author John le Carré, while Netflix has released its latest fictionalized account of the opioid epidemic in the crime drama Pain Hustlers.



With Halloween just around the corner, there are also two horror movies hitting streaming. Peacock's got Five Nights at Freddy's, the video game series-inspired tale of a rundown pizzeria where smiling animatronics turn murderous at night. Meanwhile, you can watch the latest terrifying entry in the Conjuring Universe on Max with The Nun II. Here are our top picks for movies to stream this weekend.

Pain Hustlers (Netflix)

Pain Hustlers is the latest fictionalized account of the opioid epidemic, following in the footsteps of Hulu's award-winning miniseries Dopesick and Netflix's Painkiller. This time around, Emily Blunt stars as broke but ambitious single mom Liza Drake who, in an act of desperation, becomes entangled in the opioid crisis.

After losing her job, Liza bumps into pharmaceutical sales rep Pete Brenner (Chris Evans), and begins to work at his pharmaceutical start-up that, unbeknownst to her, is struggling to keep the lights on. What was supposed to be her ticket out of living paycheck-to-paycheck turns into a dangerous racketeering scheme that puts her on an economically favorable but morally dubious path.

As she deals with her increasingly unhinged boss (Andy Garcia) and her daughter's (Chloe Coleman) health taking a turn for the worse, Liza becomes intimately familiar with the devastation her company is causing and is forced to do some soul-searching.

Five Nights at Freddy’s (Peacock)

The big screen treatment for viral horror game series Five Nights at Freddy's has long been in the works, and this week it debuts in theaters and on Peacock. Produced by Blumhouse (Get Out, M3GAN, The Purge), it sees Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt, a down-on-his-luck security guard new to the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a rundown family entertainment center with a terrifying secret.

Anyone who's played the games knows where this is going. What was supposed to be a cushy gig turns into a desperate bid for survival as the venue's Chucky Cheese-esque animatronic mascots stalk the grounds at night, tearing down anyone in their path.

While video game movie adaptations don't have the best track record, it's a good sign to see series creator Scott Cawthon listed as both a co-producer and co-writer on the Five Nights at Freddy's screenplay. And though the movie's currently sitting at an abysmal 24% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, it's notable that audiences rate it a fresh 88%. That's enough to pique my interest as someone who's only played a few (I'm a wimp with horror games) but has watched enough Game Theory videos to realize the dizzying amount of lore sprinkled throughout the series.

The Nun II (Max)

Keeping the spooky train rolling, The Nun II has landed on Max just in time for Halloween. The eighth installment of the Conjuring Universe follows the characters from the original Nun in another supernatural nightmare.

Taissa Farmiga, sister of Conjuring star Vera Farmiga, returns as Sister Irene, now settled into a new convent in Italy four years after vanquishing the Demon Nun in the first film. She’s dispatched by the cardinal to investigate a series of murders across Europe seemingly tied to the reappearance of the evil entity Valak (Bonnie Aarons).

The bloody trail leads to a boarding school in France where, unbeknownst to Irene, her friend Maurice (Jonas Bloquet) has been possessed by Valak. With the help of skeptical Sister Debra (Storm Reid), Irene must confront Maurice and find a way to exorcise Valak for good.

The Pigeon Tunnel (Apple TV Plus)

From famed documentary director Errol Morris (The Thin Blue Line, The Fog of War) comes an engaging profile of the late spy turned novelist John le Carré. Le Carré (whose real name was David Cornwell) is best known for his best-selling spy thrillers like The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

In a series of interviews conducted before the author's death, Morris asks about how Cornwell’s life influenced the work of le Carré and vice versa, delving into how the author’s complex relationship with his father had a profound impact on his worldview and writing, which ultimately reshaped the spy game in fiction forever more. The answers are interspersed with clips from TV and movie adaptations of his work along with archived interview footage and some dramatizations commissioned especially for this film.

Minions (Netflix)

If you're looking for something a little lighter than haunted animatronics, demonic nuns and the dark side of Big Pharma, the kid-friendly animated comedy Minions also lands on Netflix this weekend. This Despicable Me spin-off tells the backstory behind the army of gibberish-speaking, pill-shaped yellow peons of Gru and how they came to work for their supervillain master.

As it turns out, the Minions have been up to mischief for millennia, serving under some of the most evil monarchs, warlords, and apex predators throughout history. And they suck at it. Driven to isolation in the Arctic after pissing off one too many powerful villains, the Minions grow despondent and depressed without a master to serve. Decades later, a scouting party sets off to find a new bad guy to serve in a quest that causes mayhem across the Big Apple.

Sly (Netflix)

Netflix also has a documentary biopic debuting this week, this one on Hollywood heavyweight Sylvester Stallone. Growing up, his passion for cinema served as a means to escape the challenges of his difficult childhood, but even as he got older he continued to be defined by that same scrappy spirit. Over the course of the last 50 years, he's captivated generations of fans through his beloved characters and legendary Hollywood franchises, from Rocky to Rambo.

This documentary delves into his journey from underdog to international movie star, offering a behind-the-scenes glimpse at how his life experiences have resonated in the characters he plays on the big screen. This retrospective doc offers unmatched insight into Sly’s life and career with input from the main himself and the people who know him best.

2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,Big Brother's Blue Kim Explained The Meaning Of 'Kitty Kitty Purr ...,https://www.yahoo.com/news/entertainment/big-brother-blue-kim-explained-013003123.html,"Blue Kim didn't get a chance to impact Big Brother a whole lot, but she did leave her mark in some memorable ways. Her showmance with Jared Fields will be one of the standout elements of the season, considering he jeopardized his game by revealing his connection to Cirie Fields. Her catchphrases were also iconic, considering I heard ""Kitty kitty purr, boots down"" all season, but what does that even mean? Blue explained to CinemaBlend, and I'm still lost.

CinemaBlend and other outlets had a chance to submit questions to Blue ahead of her heading to the jury house, and many wanted to know what in the hell her catchphrase meant. Blue was happy to oblige, but I think there's an argument that the explanation left a lot to be desired:

Okay, basically, ‘Kitty kitty boots down’ is a feeling. It’s a form of expression. So when you’re walking down with the cutest, hottest, new outfit? Kitty kitty purr. Whenever you just became valedictorian for your school? Kitty kitty purr. Whenever you do anything slay, then ‘Kitty kitty purr, boots down.’ That’s exactly what it means. If you know, you know, and if you don’t, I’m sorry you’re just not part of the gang.

I think this is where I find out I'm not part of the gang and maybe just too much of a millennial to get the reference. I mean, the ""Kitty kitty purr"" part of it all seems easy enough to implement, but when am I ever going to know if something is ""slay"" enough to throw a ""boots down"" in there? Maybe the correct answer is I shouldn't try because I don't know.

Big Brother Season 25 Is Almost Over, But There's One Major Problem That I Didn't Realize I Wasn't A Fan Of Until Now

Mecole in Big Brother on CBS

I have one big complaint about this season.

For all of her iconic sayings, Blue's reads in the Big Brother house were not quite as noteworthy. For example, she was oblivious alleged alliance member Jag Bains had targeted her on Week 12, and even with warnings from Cirie, was not aware until minutes before the show went live. Certainly not a moment I'd say ""Kitty kitty purr"" to, I think.

One thing I will say is that never in a million years did I expect to hear Zingbot utter the phrase, so credit to Blue for that. Granted, it was a multiverse variant of the character, but in Big Brother, you take the wins where you can.

Blue will head to the jury house, where she'll be joined by Cory Wurtenberger, America Lopez, and Cameron Hardin. There are at least two more Houseguests that will join them there before the game ends, and if it's a traditional finale, the final judge will join them on stage ahead of the vote. It feels like a toss-up at this point on which Houseguests have the best shot at winning, but that should become clearer after this week's Head Of Household makes their move.

Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays at 10:00 p.m. ET, Tuesdays at 8:00 p.m. ET, and on Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. We are getting really close to the end of the game, so be sure to use that Paramount+ subscription to catch up on what's happening and see the final weeks play out.","Blue Kim may not have had much of an impact in Big Brother Season 25, but she certainly left her mark with her showmance with Jared Fields and catchphrase ""Kitty kitty purr, boots down"". Blue explained the phrase to CinemaBlend, which appears to be a form of expression for when something is ""slay"". The finale is fast approaching and we are yet to see who will win the game."
2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,9 plants that can grow on rocks | Tom's Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/9-plants-that-can-grow-on-rocks,"Maybe your backyard is naturally full of rocks and pebbles, or maybe you just really love the aesthetic of a rock garden. Either way, the challenge is the same: to find plants that will not just survive but thrive in a stony environment.

While all plants require a specific balance of sunlight and water, not all of them need a lot of soil — and these are the ones that are suited to grow in, around and on rocks. In fact, they often require a lot of good drainage which is why gravel soil and rocks are so suitable.

The good news is, plants that have adapted to this environment tend to be particularly hardy and low-maintenance. Their natural homes are often hot and susceptible to drought, so they’ve evolved to handle tough conditions. This means that once you’ve found and planted the right kind of vegetation, you can sit back and enjoy (with the occasional watering and pruning of course.)

So, from succulents and flowers to grasses, here are nine, rock-suitable plants to suit your garden.

1. Hens & Chicks

Sempervivum (Image credit: Shutterstock)

Also known as Sempervivum, Hens & Chicks are a type of low-lying succulent that resemble rosettes. The mother rosette (known as the ‘hen’) grows horizontally, sending out runners that root and establish into their own smaller rosettes (the ‘chicks.) Over time, this creates a pleasing patchwork mat.

Due to the way they grow and expand, Hens & Chicks are able to root into very small cracks and crannies, which makes them great for rocky environments. They are also drought-resistant and prefer full sun. There are several variations to choose from, which may feature red-tinged tips or be particularly small. Collect several, and grow them together for an even more visually-interesting mat effect.

2. Stonecrop

Stonecrop, or Sedum, is a great balance of succulent and flower. The stems and leaves are fleshy and green, suitable for dry conditions and rocky soils. But most varieties will also grow clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in a range of warm colors – Angelina Stonecrop is popular for its yellow hues.

Some Stonecrop plants tend to grow low to the ground, spreading horizontally and making a great carpet for rock walls or gravel paths. You can even buy these kinds in “tiles” to make landscaping even easier. Other types grow upright in tall clumps, with plenty of flowers. Whichever you choose, the Stonecrop is a great plant for adding some color each summer without requiring a lot of water and loamy soil.

3. Lavender

Beloved for its soothing scent and pretty purple flowers, Lavender is a favorite choice of many gardeners before you even consider its growing conditions. It can be grown directly in a rock garden or herb garden, placed in a pot or used as a border or low hedge; the upright way it grows makes it an orderly and thick barrier.

Like other rock-loving plants, Lavender prefers good drainage, lots of sun and slightly infertile soil, so don’t worry about fertilizing. The aromatic flowers can be collected, dried and used for aromatherapy needs, or just left to be enjoyed in the garden. They’re also known to attract pollinators, so growing Lavender is a great way to attract more bees and butterflies to your garden.

4. Blue Fescue

In addition to flowering plants, it’s important to consider how the garden looks year-round and include some other kinds of vegetation. Blue Fescue is an attractive kind of ornamental grass, so-called for the silvery-blue tint to its foliage. The grass is dense and grows in a fun tufted shape, reaching about a foot in diameter. This makes it useful for providing texture and filling up space with something visually different, without dominating the rock garden.

Blue Fescue does produce its own yellowish flowers each year too, but its main draw is its spiky silhouette and long, blue fronds. It prefers lots of direct sunlight but can handle a bit of shade too, making it a reliable choice in tricky conditions.

5. Yarrow

If you’re looking for some height variation in your rock garden, Yarrow (or Achillea) is a great flowering option. Once famously valued for its medicinal properties, Yarrow is now popular for its low maintenance needs and attractive flowers. It doesn’t require rocky soil to grow, but it prefers full sun and well-draining, dry soil and does surprisingly well in a gravel or pebbly environment. It caps its slim, leggy stems with large clusters of tiny packed flowers, which can be yellow, red, white or pink in color.

While a lot of rock plants grow close to the ground, this species can reach between two and four feet tall and is well-suited to grow along fencing or other border structures, or be used as visual variation within a garden. One thing to consider is that it is known to spread quite quickly, so it may be best to contain it within the broader garden.

6. Candytuft

Candytuft has a cute name and an equally cute appearance, with a rich carpet of white flowers on top of dark green foliage. It blooms early in the year, around mid-spring, which creates visual interest when the rest of your garden may be weeks away from flowering. Over time, the white flowers fade to a soft pink color, giving it another lease of life. Then, once the flowers have finished blooming, the plant is left with its deeply colored evergreen foliage throughout the winter time.

As with other rock-suitable plants, Candytuft is a hardy, drought-resistant plant that requires minimal care and can even handle some shade. While it can be known to release a slightly unpleasant aroma, it is a great addition to a rock garden for anyone wanting to add more flowers throughout the year.

7. Creeping Phlox

Also known as Phlox Subulata, Creeping Phlox is another plant that is prized for its early-spring flowering – it can transform any garden from dull and gray to vibrant and blooming. Like the Candytuft, it also features deep green foliage that stays that way year-round, although these leaves are needle-like in appearance.

Creeping Phlox prefers dry, fast-draining, poor-quality soil and so is perfectly suited to rocky terrain, despite its lush appearance. Flowers come in a range of pink, purple, blue or bicolor hues and are likely to carpet the ground; while the plant only grows a few inches in height, it does spread (or creep) along paths, across walls or down slopes. It can root into narrow crevices, making it a popular choice to decorate stone walls.

8. Basket of Gold

It should be no surprise that a plant with the common name Basket of Gold features bountiful sprays of yellow and gold flowers. Also known as Yellow Alyssum, Basket of Gold flowers in the spring with densely packed clusters of blooms that reach about a foot in height.

Its vibrant, happy color makes a great contrast to the grays and browns of rocks and stones, especially when it grows tucked inside nooks and crannies. It enjoys sunlight, well-draining soil and is considered drought-tolerant, if not drought-resistant. In warmer weather, this perennial plant may only survive for a year or two and so it may need to be replanted; cooler regions should enjoy its yellow blooms for longer.

9. Irish Moss

Unlike the other plants on this list, Irish Moss is both a plant that loves rocky terrain and loves moisture. If you live in a wet yet stony environment, such as the Pacific Northwest, then it can be very challenging to find plants that will thrive without a lot of rich soil. This is where Irish Moss can come into its own, growing into a thick, verdant carpet that can support human foot traffic.

It’s soft to the touch and produces white flowers in the spring that are reminiscent of stars. It can survive in lower light levels than most of the full-sun dependent plants on this list, which is another boon for those wetter, cooler climates. Irish Moss can also make a great companion plant to Blue Star Creeper, another perennial that forms a low-lying mat but one covered in tiny blue flowers."," foliage. It’s also adaptable to a range of soil types and drought-resistant, so ideal for an area with little soil and plenty of rocks.This article provides a summary of nine plants that are suitable for rock gardens, including Hens & Chicks, Stonecrop, Lavender and Blue Fescue. These plants are hardy, low-maintenance and drought-resistant, and can provide color and texture to the garden."
2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,I bought these fake Apple products on the Temu app - Tom's Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-bought-these-fake-apple-products-on-the-temu-app-and-i-was-totally-shocked,"A few months ago, I bought fake Apple products on the Temu app, and it was a total disaster. I received hardly-functional smartwatches, a poor-sounding pair of AirPods look-a-likes and a clear iPhone case that probably offered the same amount of protection I would get from wrapping my phone in cellophane. But curious as to whether all Apple knock-offs in the Temu marketplace suck, or if just ordered a bad lot, I made the debatable decision to purchase more devices.

Editor's Note In the time between ordering the products on Temu and reviewing them for this YouTube video, all have been removed from the Temu app marketplace.

While the Temu marketplace doesn't blatantly allow products listed under Apple’s trademarked names, the items I ordered did come up when I searched the app for things like “AirPods Max” and “Apple Watch bands.” The photos used to promote the products looked, undeniably, like the ones Apple uses on the products it manufactures and sells. What's more, most of the devices I found have been purchased and reviewed thousands of times, according to the product listings.

But how do the fakes stack up to the real things? I bought four more items from Temu — all under $15 — that look like they could be on shelves at the Apple store. Here's how they turned out.

'AirPods Max'

(Image credit: Future)

AirPods Max are some of the best headphones you can buy. Not only do they pack impressive sound and top-notch active noise cancellation, but they're packed with features like Spatial Audio and Find My, too. With their fun colors and retro look, it's no wonder the headphones have become a status item.

But the full $549 price tag is, understandably, out of a lot of people's budgets. So I can see why someone might search on Temu for a look-a-like pair. The ones I found from searching ""AirPods Max"" on the marketplace even came in all five of the real AirPods Max colors. Yet the package that arrived certainly isn't up to Apple standards — the box looked like it had been hit by a truck, with the headset practically falling out.

While they do look a AirPods Max, the headphones I bought on Temu are entirely plastic, right down to the ""mesh"" earcups that are just plastic cushions with a mesh pattern printed onto them. The headset also had a slew of buttons on the side, whereas the real AirPods Max are navigated with a digital crown.

As for sound, I was actually surprised to find that they sounded bearable. I felt a little bit of bass, and although the vocals sounded flat the overall profile wasn't as hollow as you'd think. Now, for $10 headphones, I didn't expect much. And I still believe you can find great cheap headphones that sound better if you're able to forfeit the AirPods Max look.

'AirPods Pro 2'

(Image credit: Future)

My least favorite purchase from my previous Temu haul was the AirPods. I’ve seen dozens of fake AirPods, and these were some of the worst. They didn't stand a chance against any of the best wireless earbuds. That said, the more recent pair I ordered, inspired by AirPods Pro, provided a more positive experience.

First, they came in a colorful package that reminded me of the old pop-art-style iPod advertisements. Then the AirPods themselves look very legit. The case had some healthy heft and the lid felt sturdy. The only way I could tell It from the real thing was that I had the new $249 AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for comparison, which have a different charging port.

When it came to pairing the earbuds I bought on Temu to my IPhone, I got notification that my phone could not verify that they’re true AirPods. This is a useful message Apple puts in place to dissuade people from peddling phony AirPods as the real thing. Of course, I knew I wasn't using real AirPods.

Similar to the fake AirPods Max, the sound quality of these earbuds wasn't awful. Would I say they sound good? Not really, but I think for earbuds under $10, they're better than you'd expect. Still, if it were me, I would get any of these best cheap earbuds under $25 instead.

Apple Watch Ultra bands

(Image credit: Future)

The Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra 2 come with special bands designed for specific sports. There's the Alpine Loop for mountain-style sports, Ocean Band for water sports, and the Trail Loop for outdoor running.

I'm not personally the biggest fan of Apple Watch Ultra bands, finding that none fit my style quite like some other of the best Apple Watch bands. So I wouldn't go online and order bands from Temu that look like the Apple Watch Ultra bands if not for the sake of this experiment. And after trying a $13 pack of six straps out, I wouldn't recommend you do, either.

The ""Ocean Band"" and ""Alpine Loop"" are particularly bad. They lack the premium materials and feel of the real bands, which cost $99 when purchased separate from the Apple Watch Ultra. I didn't sense they would stay secure during sports, especially the rugged ones you might face with Apple's titanium sports watch.

I only somewhat liked the fake Trail Loop, which felt soft and stretchy. It still wouldn't be my band of choice, though.

'Apple MagSafe Battery Pack'

(Image credit: Future)

The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack is one of the company's lesser-known accessories, making it possible to keep your iPhone charged when you can't get to a cord. But at $99, it's not the most affordable charging solution.

There are actually a number of wireless charging banks you can find on Temu, so I purchased the one that looked most like Apple's for $11. In person, it did look like the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack, minus the Apple logo on the back.

Unfortunately, it didn't come with a charging cord, and when I found one of my own to power it on, it didn't work. I think I ended up with a dud. This didn't totally surprise me, since when I shook the battery pack, it sounded like pieces were moving inside.

Should you buy fake Apple products on Temu?

Despite having more success with this group of products than I had before, I still do not recommend buying anything on Temu under the guise of it being an Apple device. I understand that people like to have things for the look of the brand, but most products are still not functional. And in the case of the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack, the product may arrive totally broken.

I also feel a bit uneasy about getting the notification on my iPhone warning me that I'm pairing fake AirPods. Even if the headphones sound OK, it’s not worth potentially compromising my phone. At that point, again, I think it's probably worth buying more affordable earbuds that don't attempt to pass as AirPods.

While I don't expect I'll be buying more fake Apple products on Temu, I do think there are other benefits to the app. In fact, I spent $50 on Temu for some random items with no regrets. I also purchased some holiday decorations on the app recently, and they turned out great. Perhaps just use caution when buying things that are supposed to look like something they're not."," sound is on par with what you'd expect.A total of 100 words.I recently bought fake Apple products from the Temu app and the experience was less than satisfactory. However, curious as to whether all Apple knock-offs in the Temu marketplace were bad, I made the decision to purchase more. Products like 'AirPods Max' and 'AirPods Pro 2' were found in the marketplace, but the package and sound quality of the fakes was far from Apple standards. The 'AirPods Max' were entirely plastic and the sound was bearable, while the 'AirPods Pro 2' looked more authentic but the sound quality was not great."

GOVERNOR SAYS SUSPECT WAS FOUND DEAD IN LISBON FALLS, MAINE

Maine Gov. Janet Mills confirmed at a news conference Friday night that the suspect wanted for killing 18 people at a bowling alley and bar has been found dead in Lisbon Falls, Maine.

“Like many people, I’m breathing a sign of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card is no longer a threat to anyone,” Mills said. “I also know that his death might not bring solace to many. But now is a time to heal.”

Maine’s public safety commissioner, Mike Sauschuck, said at the conference that Card was found at 7:45 pm near the Androscoggin River. He declined to provide a specific address.

Police found Card’s body at a recycling facility where he recently worked, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Lewiston Police Chief David St. Pierre said the community can now “breathe a sigh of relief.”

“This is vitally important to all of us that this conclusion came to light tonight,"" St. Pierre said. “We’re going to grieve for the families that lost love ones.”

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS AP THAT SUSPE

CT HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD

Authorities say Robert Card, who was wanted in connection with the shootings at Schemengees Bar and Grille and at Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley in Lewiston, is believed to have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, a law enforcement official tells the AP.

The official was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity. A 10 p.m. news conference was scheduled by police.

Card, 40, of Bowdoin, Maine, was a U.S. Army reservist who underwent a mental health evaluation in mid-July after he began acting erratically during training, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.

Card had been sought since the Wednesday night shootings, and murder warrants were issued against him.

A bulletin sent to police across the country shortly after the attack said Card had been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks this past summer after “hearing voices and threats to shoot up” a military base.

A U.S. official said Card was training with the Army Reserve’s 3rd Battalion, 304th Infantry Regiment in West Point, New York, when commanders became concerned about him.

State police took Card to the Keller Army Community Hospital at West Point for evaluation, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the information and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity

— Associated Press writer Lolita Baldor in Washington contributed to this report.

ALL 18 VICTIMS OF MAINE MASS SHOOTING NAMED

Maine’s public safety commissioner has named all 18 victims and said all their families have been notified.

Photos of the victims were posted on a board behind Commissioner Mike Sauschuck as he read the names at a news conference Friday. A moment of silence followed.

Sauschuck also said officials have lifted a shelter-in-place order for communities instituted after the mass shooting Wednesday night, but the search for the suspect continues.

“This is not to say the crisis is over, the emergency is over,” Sauschuck said. “We want residents to remain vigilant.”

The 16 males and two females killed Wednesday night ranged in age from 14 to 76, the medical examiner said Friday.

Maine State Police said seven people died at Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley, and eight more died at Schemengees Bar and Grille. Three others died after being taken to hospitals.

POLICE CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION IN RIVER AND AT CRIME SCENES

Sauschuck said divers were continuing their search of the Androscoggin River near a boat launch in Lisbon where suspect Robert Card’s car was discovered. He said divers had been in the water as part of the investigation.

“We’re not going to finish that search this evening,” he said Friday. “But tomorrow we’ll have additional diving resources available to us from out-of-state in addition to in-state teams.""

Law enforcement officials said they have not seen the 40-year-old Army reservist since his vehicle was left at a boat ramp Wednesday shortly after the shootings.

Sauschuck said the investigation is also continuing at the bowling alley and bar.

AMID SEARCH FOR SHOOTING SUSPECT, BUSIEST PART OF DEER SEASON SET TO BEGIN

As officials in Maine search for Card, hunters are preparing for a big moment in deer season Saturday.

“Maine Resident Only Day” serves as the kickoff to the busiest stretch of the state’s popular deer hunting season.

Sauschuck said at a news conference Friday morning that he was aware that the season was starting and that he had conversations about it with Judy Camuso, the commissioner of the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. People should expect to hear more about that later in the day, he said.

“It’s a big deal in Maine, and it may not big deal for a lot of people from other communities, but we know what that’s going to look like,” Sauschuck said. “We also know we’re in the woods. You know, if you just happen to be in the woods, minding your own business, going for a walk, that’s going to make us a little concerned.”

NOTE ADDRESSED TO SON OF MAINE MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT FOUND

Investigators found a note at a home associated with Card on Thursday that was addressed to his son, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press.

The officials described it as a suicide note but said it didn’t provide any specific motive for the shooting.

Card’s cellphone had also been recovered in the home, making a search more complicated because authorities routinely use phones to track suspects, the officials said.

A gun was found in the white Subaru that Card abandoned, the officials said. Federal agents were testing the gun to determine if it was used in the shooting and conducting a trace to determine when and where the gun was obtained, the officials said.

Federal agents conducted several searches of properties associated with Card on Thursday, collecting a number of items, including electronics. Investigators are also analyzing Card’s financial information and reviewing his social media posts, writings and his mental health history, the officials said.

The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

INVESTIGATORS RECEIVE MORE THAN 500 TIPS IN SEARCH FOR SHOOTING SUSPECT

Investigators in Maine have received more than 500 tips as they prepare to add river divers to the massive search for the suspect in the Lewiston mass killing.

Investigators are checking those tips off their list as they work, Sauschuck said at a news conference Friday morning.

People can expect to see investigators at the two shooting scenes in coming days as they process “every square inch of these facilities,” he said.

In addition to those sites, he said divers and other investigators will be searching Friday at the Androscoggin River, near where Card's car was found.

“We are on 24 hours, and we will be, until the suspect in this case is brought to justice,” Sauschuck said.

SEARCH FOR SUSPECT IN SHOOTING PROMPTS DREAD IN MAINE

The ongoing search for Card has prompted dread around the state.

Much of Thursday’s search focused on a large property belonging to one of Card’s relatives in rural Bowdoin, where concerned locals said Card could have the upper hand in navigating the rural, wooded area that he knows well.

In Portland, some restaurants and bars closed their doors, bringing an unusual early evening quiet to the typically bustling downtown of the state’s largest city.

One popular seafood joint posted a sign on its door saying it would remain closed while the staff awaited word on the search. Another restaurant canceled reservations Thursday “for the safety of our guests and staff.”

Androscoggin Sheriff Eric Samson said Friday that organizers of any upcoming events should consider postponing unless “appropriate resources and planning allow for a safe event.” Many county and municipal officials are being asked to provide officers at community events, he said, but there are not enough to cover them all.

President Joe Biden was updated by his staff on the latest information about the shooting, White House officials said Friday. Biden spoke with FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said more than 200 FBI personnel are in Maine to help with the investigation.

LEWISTON SCHOOLS WILL BE CLOSED FRIDAY, SUPERINTENDENT SAYS

LEWISTON, Maine — Lewiston Public Schools will be closed again Friday, according to a post by Superintendent Jake Langlais on the district’s website.

“We remain in a shelter in place situation,” the post said. “We will not open buildings or run bus transportation.”

The superintendent said students and staff have been directly impacted by the shooting and the events since 7 p.m. Wednesday are “unimaginable.”

School officials in Maine’s largest city of Portland will decide by 5 a.m. Friday whether to open based on information received from police, according to a post on the district’s website.

Bates College in Lewiston also canceled classes Friday and postponed the inauguration of the school’s first Black president, Garry Jenkins, the school's website said.

Richard Moll, the actor best known for his role on Night Court , has died. He was 80.

A rep for the actor confirmed the news to PEOPLE, saying Moll died peacefully in his home in Big Bear Lake on Thursday.

Moll was born in Pasadena, California, on Jan. 13, 1943 and was the youngest of three children. After graduating the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in History, he pursued his love for acting — though his roles were initially limited due to his tall stature.

With his deep voice and 6'8"" frame, Moll eventually became a household name for his portrayal of Bull Shannon, a bailiff, in Night Court from 1984 to 1992.

The Emmy-nominated NBC sitcom, which also starred Harry Anderson and John Larroquette, ran for nine seasons and followed young judge Harold ""Harry"" T. Stone (Anderson) as he presided over a Manhattan Criminal Court during the night shift.

Moll, who had a shaved head for the role, quickly became a fan favorite for his catchphrase ""Ooo-kay"" after his character realized he made a mistake. He was not involved when Night Court was rebooted to NBC for the 2022-23 season.

In 1985, Moll was nominated for a Saturn award for his performance in a horror movie called House. His career then transcended into animation and voiced Harvey Dent/Two-Face on The Adventures of Batman & Robin, as well as Scorpion on Spider-Man: The Animated Series.

The actor also starred in The Flintstones, Jingle All the Way, Casper Meets Wendy and Scary Movie 2. He also snagged a recurring role in Getting By, a sitcom that starred Cindy Williams, and lent his voice to a bodyguard in an animated series titled Mighty Max.

Though he often “relished” the opportunity to play the “bad guy,” in 1999 Moll was cast against type and took on the role of a gay man who shepherded teenagers suspected of being queer to in a “re-education camp” in a satirical romcom called But I’m a Cheerleader.

His other appearances in television included Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, 7th Heaven, Smallville, No Place Like Home, Cold Case and Headless Horseman.

As an avid bird watcher and lover of the outdoors, Moll eventually retired in a mountain community in Big Bear Lake.

Last meeting: Pittsburgh won 27-3 in Jacksonville on Nov. 22, 2020.

About the Jaguars

The Jaguars will try to post their first five-game winning streak since 2005 and go to 6-2 or better for the first time since 1999 when they face the Steelers for 26th time in franchise history -- the most games against an opponent except for their current AFC South foes.

The Jaguars have won five of their last six games in Pittsburgh, counting a 2018 victory in the AFC divisional round. The Jags lost their first four games in franchise history at Pittsburgh but won the first game in franchise history over the Steelers, 20-16, in 1996.

Lawrence is facing the Steelers for the first time. He is 1-1 against AFC North opponents. The Jags lost to Cincinnati 24-21 when he was a rookie and beat Baltimore 28-27 last year. He threw for a combined 635 yards in those two games.

About the Steelers

Pittsburgh's four victories this season have all been one-score games, with an average margin of 5.6 points. The Steelers' two losses, to San Francisco and Houston, were by combined scores of 60-13.

The Steelers are next-to-last in the NFL in total offense and third from the bottom in total defense. In fairness to their offense, they have faced four teams currently ranked among the top-10 in the NFL in total defense, including No. 1 Cleveland and No. 2 Baltimore.

Jaguars coach Doug Pederson is 1-1 against the Steelers as a head coach with Philadephia. The Eagles won 34-3 in 2016 and lost 39-28 in 2020.

Key Matchup

Jaguars CB Darious Williams vs. Steelers WR George Pickens

Williams has three interceptions this season, all coming in successive games, with one returned for a touchdown. He's a big reason the Jags lead the NFL in passes defensed with 44 (Williams has 11 to lead the team) and are second in the NFL in interceptions with nine.

Pickens leads the Steelers with 27 receptions for 500 yards and three touchdowns. His 18.5 yards per reception is second in the NFL behind Nico Collins of Houston (18.9).

If Tyson Campbell can't play, Williams will be needed more than ever to shut down an opponent's best receiver. The Steelers have had trouble running the ball this season they would need to break a big play or two through the air to have a chance.

Jaguars cornerback Darious Williams (31) intercepts a pass against Indianapolis on Oct. 15.

Adding spice to this matchup has been somewhat of a tepid war of words this week. Pickens called the Jaguars a ""hope"" defense.

""With their team having a lot of first-round guys on that D-Line, that's what they depend on a lot,"" he said. ""They kind of hope, hope the guys hold up long enough, so it's kinda a 'hope defense' for sure.""

Jaguars safety Rayshawn Jenkins had a gentle barb of his own.

""I know that the receiver we have coming in this week, No. 14 [Pickens], he has high yards per catch,"" Jenkins said. ""But respectfully, he hasn't played our corners yet. So I'll say that,""

2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,"USB-C Magic Mouse expected at Apple event, but no word on port ...",https://www.tomsguide.com/news/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event-but-no-word-on-port-placement,"We're just a few days away from Apple's ‘Scary Fast’ event, where all signs point to the tech giant unveiling a new 3-nanometer M3 chip along with a slew of new Macs powered by the latest Apple silicon. But that's not all: Apple's likely to announce new versions of its Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad for Mac featuring USB-C ports, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman this week.

The October Apple event is set to kick off on October 30 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. The showcase will be entirely virtual, unlike the in-person get-together we saw in September that gave us the new iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9 models.

Gurman expects Apple to show off the revamped accessories alongside new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros and an updated iMac sporting the ""scary fest"" M3 chip.

""As part of a broader shift to USB-C connectors, the company will likely roll out updated versions of accessories — including its trackpad, mouse and keyboard — that ditch the old Lightning ports,"" he said.

Apple has long been the outlier where charging cables are concerned, holding on to its proprietary Lightning cable even as other tech giants made the switch to more universal charging standards. But not even Apple can avoid the winds of change forever — the company made it official that starting with the iPhone 15, iPhones of the future will fall in line and feature a USB-C port. In part because its hand was forced by new EU regulations requiring all phone makers to adopt the USB-C port before the end of 2024.

Could the switch to USB-C fix the Magic Mouse's biggest design flaw?

The writing has long been on the wall for Apple's switch, but what's less clear is whether these revamped accessories will feature any other design changes beyond the new USB-C ports. The designs for Apple's trackpad, mouse, and keyboard have remained largely beyond minor revisions since their last major update in 2015. In recent years, we've seen new color options introduced with the 24-inch iMac, and Apple brought the Touch ID tech from its older iPhone models to the Magic Keyboard.

While USB-C charging for the Magic Mouse, one of the most popular devices among those who use the best MacBooks, would be a welcome update, there’s another design feature in desperate need of a revamp. If you use Apple’s mouse, you probably already know what I'm talking about considering the Magic Mouse’s biggest design flaw has become a meme at this point. For the Apple Magic Mouse to truly be one of the best mice, it needs to ditch the charging port on its underside.

That particular placement renders Apple's mouse useless when it's being charged, which is inconvenient as hell. It's unclear if the new version's design will place the USB-C port in a less frustrating location, but we have our fingers crossed that Apple may be fixing this headache once and for all with its switch from Lightning to USB-C.","Apple is set to announce their new M3 chip at their virtual event on October 30, as well as new versions of their Magic Keyboard, Mouse and Trackpad with USB-C ports.

LOUIS COUNTY — The superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County has been placed on administrative leave for an “internal personnel matter,” according to a memo sent Friday to staff members.

Elizabeth Keenan took the top role in the special education district in 2019 at a salary of $245,000. Keenan came to St. Louis County after a two-year stint in Chicago Public Schools, where she led the district’s troubled special education program while it was under state oversight.

Most of the 23,000 students in the Special School District attend their home schools where they receive assistance from district staff. The district also oversees education in the county’s juvenile detention center and runs several specialized schools including North Tech and South Tech high schools. The district has a $500 million budget.

A subcommittee of the Special School District board met Friday afternoon in part to update the policy on discrimination, harassment and retaliation, according to the agenda. The full board then met in a special closed session.

An unsigned memo sent soon after to nearly 6,000 district employees came with several warnings involving Keenan’s departure.

“Employees should refrain from gossip or speculation regarding a confidential personnel matter such as this one. Such behavior detracts from one’s job duties and from the care and education of students, and should thus be avoided. Further, only the Board or its specific designees are authorized to speak publicly regarding this matter on behalf of the District,” the memo read.

Staff were also reminded in the memo of anti-retaliation policies in the district, and told to discuss concerns with an administrator if they “are experiencing any form of retaliation.”

Michael Maclin, the district’s executive director of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, will become acting superintendent, according to the letter. Maclin started at Special School District in 2020 and has worked as a principal in the Parkway and University City school districts.","The Special School District of St. Louis County has placed its superintendent, Elizabeth Keenan, on administrative leave due to an ""internal personnel matter.""

Website identifies places for financial donations to support victims, families, and responders and responding organizations in wake of tragic shootings

Lewiston, MAINE – Governor Janet Mills today announced the launch of a “Healing Together” resource website that identifies places accepting financial donations to support victims, families, first responders, and responding organizations in wake of this week’s tragic shooting in Lewiston.

The website, available at maine.gov/governor/mills/Lewiston, also identifies mental health resources from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to support anyone affected by the violence in Lewiston who may be struggling.

The website lists community funds established by the Maine Community Foundation, the L-A Metro Chamber, the United Way of Androscoggin County, and Central Maine Medical Center that will deliver financial supports to those affected by the shootings, and those organizations involved in the community and heath care response. It also contains information about the Family Assistance Center for victims of the tragedy that opened today at the Lewiston Armory, 65 Central Avenue in Lewiston, and a public counseling center at the Ramada Inn, 490 Pleasant Street in Lewiston.

The website aims to help channel the groundswell of state, regional and national support for the victims and families of this week’s shooting.

“In the face of great tragedy and difficulty, it is a hallmark of Maine people to come together to love and support one another,” said Governor Janet Mills. “To that end, I know many people right now are asking, ‘How can I help?’ I encourage Maine people to use and share our ‘Healing Together’ website as a resource to support the families of the victims and the greater Lewiston community as we begin the long and difficult process of healing.”

Earlier this week, the Governor addressed the people of Maine and asked them to join her in helping Lewiston and people impacted by the tragedy recover. The Governor has pledged the full weight of her Administration behind all efforts to seek justice for the victims and their families.","Governor Janet Mills has launched a website, Healing Together, which provides a list of funds and resources to help victims, families, first responders, and responding organizations in the wake of the Lewiston, Maine shooting.

Check out these companies,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/is-domestic-travel-back-on-track-check-out-these-companies/464487,"Growing GDP figures create a trickle-down effect on these domestic leisure names. Markets and analysts are all over this domino effect.

This story originally appeared on MarketBeat

The United States economy has achieved something most bears never expected: gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 4.9% during the past quarter, whereas economists only expected a 4.7% jump. Even in real growth terms, considering inflation, things have improved past any point of concern.

Some analysts ask whether this growth will begin to trickle down into specific industries and consumer behavior, such as domestic travel trends. With a strong dollar, some Americans travel overseas, where budgets can significantly increase.

Regarding consumer discretionary stocks, two domestic names stand out, and analysts believe that the macro growth has a direct path to benefit them. Otherwise, a double-digit upside assigned to both would be unusual for Wall Street. Even in today's shifting trends, you can have a chance at beating the market this quarter.

A new beginning

Starting with what has grabbed the market's attention lately, earnings season, you will soon find out why Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL) can bring your portfolio a feeling of summer while being smack in the middle of wintertime.

Interestingly, each stock's performance can tell you year-to-date, especially against the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLY). While Royal Caribbean has outperformed the sector by as much as 57.8%, Southwest has fallen far behind.

With an underperformance of 43.8% in the sector, it looks like flying domestically is less attractive than an exotic destination in one of Royal Caribbean's ships. This is somewhat understandable, as the rising oil prices have caused flight prices to increase, and Airbnb's wild-west pricing model is not enticing enough to book in the U.S.

Despite the difference in performance, the underlying opportunity remains the same. With both of these stocks reaching fresh 52-week lows, the opening for a gap rebound is what you should be looking for, despite what bears may warn you about.

MarketBeat has an excellent stock screening tool you can use to filter out for low price-to-earnings stocks, where names like Southwest and Royal Caribbean will appear as tremendously attractive, ones that analysts are reasonably bullish about.

The market has voted

Contrary to widespread value investment practice, you want to look for stocks valued above a sector average multiple, such as the forward P/E, where markets attempt to place a value on the next 12 months of earnings expectations.

In the case of airline stocks, you can see how and why Southwest is a clear winning outlier.

Where the sector carries an average forward P/E of 5.5x, Southwest stock comes in with an 8.5x valuation, and there's good reason for it. Your job is to reverse-engineer some reasons why the market may be willing to pay a premium above names like United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).

United and American analysts expect earnings to decline by 2.5% and 5% for the next twelve months, respectively. This is way below the industry average of 12.3%, so they are trading at valuations below the industry, 3.2x and 4.1x for each.

Southwest projects a 49.4% jump in EPS for next year, above the industry average and more than enough justification for markets to pay a premium for this stock today. Analysts have placed a price target of $34.2 a share, implying a net upside of 46.2% from today's prices.

What about Royal Caribbean? While the universe of cruise line stocks is smaller, this stock is still a perceived winner.

With an average forward P/E of 8.2x, Royal Caribbean comes out ahead with its 10.0x valuation. The driver behind the preference? Analysts are pushing for EPS to advance by as much as 35.9% in the next 12 months, ahead of the industry's expected 15.5%.

These assumptions have allowed analysts to land on a consensus price target of $111.6 a share for this stock, calling for a tremendous 34.2% rally to meet these predictions.

Growing GDP can only mean a wave of confidence and spending sure to come. The markets have already picked their dream team lineup for domestic leisure.","hts, far ahead of its peers.Analysts have placed a price target of $135 a share, implying a net upside of 20.8% from today's prices.In summary, growing GDP figures have created a trickle-down effect on certain domestic leisure names, resulting in markets and analysts favoring Southwest Airlines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, with expected 46.2% and 20.8% upside respectively."

The first amendment would equalize debt constraints for all of the state’s school districts. Since the 1950s, though, small-city districts have been limited to 5% of the value of the district’s property tax base. In other districts, the limit is 10%. That creates an unnecessary and unhelpful financial disadvantage for the smaller districts. It’s a quirk in the constitution that state voters need to rectify.

The second proposed amendment on the ballot also deals with debt, but this one for construction of sewage treatment facilities – the sort of project that, when necessary, few would oppose. Specifically, the amendment would renew for 10 years the authority of counties, cities, towns and villages to remove debt for the construction of sewage facilities from their constitutional debt limits. The state has allowed that practice since 1963, but must be reauthorized every 10 years. It’s worth doing again.","Voters will find two proposed amendments to the state constitution on the back of this year's ballots.

The primary purpose of this initiative is to empower decision-makers to utilize this standardized tool and have the capacity to design and evaluate policies addressing various economic impacts, both those generated by internal variables and external factors.

The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is a data framework that intricately reflects the economic structure of a country, as well as the economic and social structure of a society in a particular year. It provides the necessary statistical basis for constructing a useful model to analyze the effects of specific economic policies on relevant macroeconomic variables. Additionally, the use of multiplier models has proven to be a robust instrument for analyzing the effects of different economic policies and the relationships between sectors and institutions in the economy, enabling comparisons of economic structures between different countries.

Furthermore, IFPRI has developed a social accounting matrix for Colombia, which served as the main input for designing this course with the aim of building capacities among a network of stakeholders to utilize these tools. This course is complemented by a series of both virtual and in-person meetings. In the initial training stage, 26 representatives from public entities, private companies, academic institutions, and research centers participated.

Researchers from the CGIAR, Valeria Piñeiro, Johana Castillo, Luis Escalante, and Elsa Olivetti, delve deeper into the implementation of these tools with this new network of stakeholders through three planned virtual meetings for coordination, addressing questions, and monitoring the learning process that will lead them to March 2024, when the second in-person part of the course will take place, addressing general equilibrium topics using the IFPRI’s RIAPA model. In the following videos, the researchers expand on this information and comment on their experience:

The course focused on providing a detailed explanation of each component of the social accounting matrix, with full access to all the data. It also offered an introduction to the use of the GAMS program through practical exercises in which participants ran simple models. Moreover, the course covered essential concepts, such as economic linkages and the multiplier effect, and introduced the comprehensive analysis of Colombia’s economy.

These activities can contribute to decision-making and the formulation of effective policies within the economic context of Colombia. They equip participants with the necessary tools to understand and assess the impact of policies on the country’s economy.

Below, some of the participants, representatives of relevant institutions in the sector at a national level such as Agrosavia, DANE, Finagro, and the academy, share their perspectives on the course.

2023-10-28T00:00:00.0000000,Don’t kid yourself Jacinta: Victoria’s new ... - Sky News Australia,https://www.skynews.com.au/insights-and-analysis/dont-kid-yourself-jacinta-victorias-new-premier-is-no-joan-kirner-a-leader-who-at-least-grasped-the-severity-of-her-states-financial-situation/news-story/0b53b61a1d0f7df99f552137dd15466e,"In the mountain of coverage about Victoria’s new Premier one point has been particularly common – a comparison of Jacinta Allan to Joan Kirner, Victoria’s second female Premier to its first.

Ms Allan invited this comparison, after referring to Mrs Kirner - premier from 1990-92 - as a ""wonderful mentor"" in her first media appearance as Premier.

Superficially, I get it.

But when you scratch the surface the two are like chalk and cheese.

Sure, they both inherited the leadership of the state when its finances were a total shambles.

Yet Joan had little to do with the financial malaise created by the Cain Labor Government.

This was on the head of the Premier and the men he put in charge of the state’s coffers.

Joan was busy as Minister for Conservation, and then running the state’s education system.

In these roles she did some good things.

She brought in the Victorian Certificate of Education, for example.

On the other hand, Victoria’s current financial woes are very much of Ms Allan’s own making.

As the long-standing Minister for Transport Infrastructure, she presided over almost $30 billion in waste and blow-outs.

All of the Government’s key projects, which Ms Allan had carriage of, are billions over budget: the West Gate Tunnel, Melbourne Metro, the North East Link and – of course – the pièce de résistance, the Suburban Rail Loop.

Ms Allan promised the entire loop would not top $50 billion, yet the independent Parliamentary Budget Office has costed just the first two thirds at $125bn.

By the time it’s finished some time late this century, it will undoubtedly have cost Victorians over $200 billion – despite the fact that the project has no business case and has been canned by numerous transport experts.

Another key difference is that Mrs Kirner grasped, at least in part, the severity of Victoria’s financial situation.

Consequently, she made some hard decisions, such as selling the State Bank and starting to privatise the transport sector.

She should have done more.

But she got there was an issue, and she acted.

The media may have derided Mrs Kirner as “Mother Russia”, but she was both smart and tough enough to borrow from the playbook of liberal economists like Milton Friedman, rather than cave entirely to the predilection of her own party for ever-more public ownership.

Victoria’s financial situation is far worse today than it was in the late 1980s.

We have more debt than New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania combined, and our daily interest repayments are set to top $20 million.

To make matters worse, since coming to government, Labor has introduced or increased more than 50 taxes, exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis.

But Ms Allan shows no inkling of what should be done to rein in debt and reduce Victoria’s nation-leading tax take.

Indeed, the first action of her government was yet another tax, this time on so-called vacant properties.

Finally, while a true Labor warrior, in my experience Mrs Kirner was prepared to reach out across the aisle.

In the Baillieu Government, from 2010, I was an adviser to the Minister for Community Services, while Mrs Kirner was Chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee for Victorian Communities.

The first time she called me I was terrified, of course.

But in the former Premier I found someone who put the interests of vulnerable Victorians first and who worked closely with me, and Minister Mary Wooldridge, in good faith.

We had huge ideological differences, but we could work together.

On the other hand, even the Premier’s staunchest allies acknowledge that she is a deeply partisan politician.

I congratulate Ms Allan on taking the Premiership, and wish her every success; we all should. Yet let’s not kid ourselves: she’s no Joan Kirner.","reship, but I urge caution.Jacinta Allan has been compared to Joan Kirner after referencing her as a ""wonderful mentor"" in her first media appearance as Victoria's Premier.

Crawford ground attack cages Seneca East in playoff opener,https://www.richlandsource.com/2023/10/28/col-crawford-ground-attack-cages-seneca-east-in-playoff-opener/,"NORTH ROBINSON — Micah Thomas powered for 162 yards and two touchdowns to spearhead a strong rushing attack that propelled Colonel Crawford to a 24-16 playoff win over Seneca East on Friday night.

The Eagles gained 295 yards rushing to key the victory in a Division VI, Region 22 playoff opener.

C.C. jumped on top in the first period when Thomas scored from 10 yards and Braxton Morton’s PAT gave the home squad a 7-0 edge.

Connor McMichael added a 1-yard blast in the second period, and Morton drilled a 45-yard field goal to push the margin to 17-0 at halftime.

Thomas tacked on a 7-yard scoring jaunt in the third quarter for what seemed to be a comfortable 24-0 gap.

But the Tigers responded with two touchdowns and a pair of two-point conversions to make things interesting in the fourth quarter. However, the rally ended right there.

McMichael also ran for 103 yards as the Eagles fashioned a 295-43 advantage on the ground.

Yet Seneca East stayed in the game by throwing for 260 yards to just 43 for the Eagles. Colonel Crawford led in first downs (21 to 11) and total yards (338-303).

A key part of the game was C.C.’s defense in the clutch, stopping the Tigers cold on third down. Seneca East was 0-of-7 on third-down conversions.

The third-seeded Eagles (10-1) will host No. 6 seed Ottawa Hills on Friday night in North Robinson. C.C. will bring a five-game winning streak into that contest. Its lone loss was a 27-7 decision at Carey on Sept. 22.

The Green Bears are 10-1 and have a seven-game winning streak. Their lone defeat was a 26-21 verdict to Whiteford (Mich.) on Sept. 8.

Seneca East finished the campaign with a 5-6 record. This marked the second time this season Colonel Crawford got the better of the Tigers. The first time was a 29-14 decision on Sept. 15.","Colonel Crawford won their Division VI, Region 22 playoff opener against Seneca East 24-16, powered by Micah Thomas' 162 yards and two touchdowns.

The partnership, formalized through a distribution agreement in 2010 of Markaz’s real estate funds, designated Gulf Bank as a Selling Agent of Markaz’s investment funds through its Priority Banking network located in selected branches throughout the country.

Subsequently, the partnership expanded to include bonds and real estate club deals in the USA and GCC. Through this partnership, both Markaz and Gulf Bank continue to provide investment opportunities for potential investors with interest in the real estate sector, regionally and internationally.

Distribution of Markaz’s Real Estate Funds

The Markaz and Gulf Bank partnership facilitates the distribution of Markaz's flagship investment products - the Markaz Real Estate Fund (MREF), distributed since 2010, and the Markaz Gulf Real Estate Fund (MGREF), launched in 2014 and first distributed in 2015 through the bank. Whereas MREF aims to generate stable and recurring Shari'ah-compliant returns by investing in Kuwaiti real estate properties, MGREF is a privately placed open-ended fund investing in income-generating properties in the GCC's most promising real estate segments to generate stable income and returns through sound property acquisition, management, and disposal. Both funds present clients with the opportunity to invest in the real estate sector and benefit from the investment advantages provided by real estate assets for a lower monetary value than acquiring real estate directly, under the supervision of efficient and expert fund managers, accompanied with monthly returns.

Capital Market Services

In light of this partnership, Markaz and Gulf Bank collaborated in the capital markets field, given the extensive expertise attributed to each of the organizations and the broad investor base each enjoys. Accordingly, Markaz was assigned as the issuance manager for Gulf Banks bonds, which stood at KWD 100 million in value. Both organizations also came together as joint issuance managers for Markaz’s KWD 25 million bonds, which were issued that same year. Issuances for other companies then followed, which were managed by both Markaz and Gulf Bank, reaffirming the mutual trust in the execution and distribution network capabilities of both entities. This partnership also witnessed the fruition (in cooperation with other issuance managers at times) of seven bond issuances with a total value of KWD 455 million, which contributed to building a solid base for the Kuwaiti bond market.

Joint Real Estate Deal

Furthermore, Markaz offered Gulf Bank clients the opportunity to invest in the GCC; specifically in Saudi Arabia through its Riyadh and Khubar based offices, and in the UAE through its Dubai and Abu Dhabi offices. In terms of international markets, Markaz offered investment opportunities in the USA through its international real estate arm Mar-Gulf, through Markaz’s value-added US program, and through residential projects in both Texas and Missouri, which are private placements.

Commenting on the long-standing partnership with Gulf Bank, Abdullatif W. Al-Nusif, Managing Director of Wealth Management and Business Development at Markaz, said: “We take immense pride in our long-standing partnership with Gulf Bank, which has spanned over a decade, as we continue to offer our investment products to the bank’s clients. We have achieved remarkable milestones together that have allowed us to enable the investment community through tailored funds, providing them with opportunities to invest in the real estate sector. We look forward to continued success and growth in the future.”

In his statement, Tariq Al-Saleh, Deputy General Manager of Investments at Gulf Bank, expressed, ""We take immense pride in our enduring partnership with Markaz. It highlights our dedication to offering clients an array of innovative investment products tailored to their requirements, empowering them to enhance their wealth.""

He further stated, ""At Gulf Bank, our goal is to enhance our strategic collaboration with Kuwaiti companies operating in the capital markets, notably the Kuwait Financial Center. This aligns with our ongoing initiatives to bolster Gulf Bank's essential role in energizing the local capital market. We are dedicated to consistently offering exceptional investment opportunities to our customers.""

Over the years, Markaz has consistently provided a range of funds tailored to meet the evolving requirements of investors in a dynamic investment landscape. Through its collaboration with Gulf Bank, a prominent financial services provider with an extensive branch network, Markaz has expanded the accessibility of its investment products to a broader and more diverse investor base. Moreover, this aligns seamlessly with Gulf Bank's commitment to provide its customers with wide-ranging investment options.

Here is a glimpse of the tax happening in the world this week.

1. Finland proposes legislation on minimum tax for large corporations

Finland’s Ministry of Finance has issued a statement regarding the draft Bill HE 77/2023 for implementing the global minimum tax under Pillar 2, as per Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523, dated December 14, 2022.

This draft bill encompasses the introduction of the Pillar 2 income inclusion rule (IIR) and the undertaxed payment/profit rule (UTPR) to ensure that multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with annual consolidated revenues of at least EUR 750 million over a minimum of two of the preceding four fiscal years adhere to a minimum tax rate of 15%.

The proposal also includes introducing a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT) for members of groups subject to these rules, referred to as a domestic supplementary tax in Finland.

Currently, the IIR and QDMTT will apply to financial periods commencing on or after December 31, 2023, while the UTPR will generally apply to financial periods starting on or after December 31, 2024.

However, in cases where another EU Member State elects not to apply the IIR and the UTPR for six consecutive fiscal years commencing from December 31, 2023 (as per Article 50 of the Directive), the UTPR will be enforced for financial periods starting on or after December 31, 2023, in relation to MNE groups headquartered in that particular Member State.

Why are you running for office?

I am running to continue to give a voice to parents, to provide a supportive environment for teachers and staff, and to provide sound fiscal oversight and district governance for our taxpayers.

​What change do you want to see?

I am working for changes in our grading system and standards, a safer school environment, and to reverse the decline in student enrollment since COVID. Also, I have actively worked to drive the spread of STEM-related activities through the growth of robotics for our elementary and middle school students.

What experience do you bring?

I was first elected to the Board of Education in 2011 and am running for my fourth term. I have previously served as President and Vice President of the Board, as well as several years on the Finance Committee and the Pottawattamie County Assessor's Conference Board. I also helmed our superintendent search in 2017. In that time, we have worked to change expectations in our community through the creation of exciting opportunities like the Early College Academy and our Tradeworks Program. I have worked to remodel many of our schools and athletic facilities and have led during difficult decisions such as abrupt changes in state laws, COVID masking fights, and school closure decisions.

How do you describe your politics?

If you know me, you know I have no agenda other than to improve our schools for all of our students and our community. To be an effective school board member, you can't be looking for your next political move. You should focus on serving students first.

Why should voters select you?

I bring a level-headed approach to governance and work to understand the needs and viewpoints of students, families, employees, and taxpayers before discussing issues at the boardroom table.

It’s not clear who will ...,https://wacotrib.com/news/local/a-generation-of-texas-farmers-are-retiring-it-s-not-clear-who-will-replace-them/article_e617122a-6dfe-11ee-b661-83bfe73a774e.html,"LITTLEFIELD — Jimmy Drake started farming when he was 18.

He had grown up learning the intricacies of agriculture alongside his father under the unforgiving West Texas sun. He would come home covered in dirt that is good for little but growing cotton.

He has managed the land for the last seven decades. There has been abundance. There has been devastation. Through it all, Drake was propelled by a sense of family and purpose. He belonged to the land as much as it belonged to him.

And then, last year, a longtime employee resigned. Working 2,500 acres — more than three times the size of the State Fair of Texas — alone was suddenly daunting. At 85, Drake had to call it quits. But unlike his father and grandfather before him, Drake’s children won’t be taking on the farm.

Drake, who is now 86 years old, is not the only farmer who has faced this dilemma. He won’t be the last. In 2017, there were nearly 41,000 Texas farmers who were 75 or older. There were another 65,000 between the ages of 65 and 74. It’s as much a fact as the sun rises in the east: Texas farmers are getting older and can’t continue the hard labor.

The steady increase in the age of farmers is not unique to Texas, and is part of a national trend — the 2017 agriculture census found the average age of all U.S. farm producers rose 1.2 years from the 2012 census.

In many cases, they either don’t have family to leave their land to or their family doesn’t want it. Drake’s son is a retired farmer himself.

“We are elderly and we don’t have enough young people coming along,” said Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. “A lot of these farmers will sell because none of their heirs want to take over the operation.”

Drake was a lucky one. Tanner Heffington, a young, trusted neighbor who also had farming in his blood, agreed to take care of the land.

“I was glad Tanner was there, but it still didn’t feel too good because my family’s been farming that land,” Drake said. “But, time marches on.”

For the first time in two generations, the Drake farm wouldn’t be taken care of by the family — a reality for Drake harder to grasp than the dry soil underneath his boots.

Cotton was Drake’s lifelong friend — and bitter rival at times. He couldn’t simply call it quits and let his land go to the next highest bidder. Had it not been for his employee leaving, Drake said he could still go.

Whit Weems, who leads education outreach at Texas Farm Bureau, said even though there are a lot of producers reaching retirement age, farmers rarely make the choice to officially retire.

“Farming and ranching is a passion and a lifelong calling,” Weems said. “It’s something farmers will continually do, up until death or their health doesn’t allow it.”

For Drake, finding someone to take it over was easy in Littlefield, a small town nearly 40 miles northwest of Lubbock.

Heffington is Drake’s best friend’s grandson, and someone Drake considers family.

Heffington, 31, and Drake have a bond that has grown naturally over Heffington’s lifetime. For as long as Heffington remembers, the two have had lunch every Sunday and talk on the phone regularly. Drake has memories of Heffington running around as a toddler and remembers when, as a teenager, Heffington accidentally started a large grass fire in town that ended up being front page news.

Heffington jokes that Drake didn’t give him much of a choice about taking on his 2,500 acres.

“It takes a certain kind,” Drake said. “You gotta be bred for it.”

The two have also bonded over agriculture, particularly the pride they feel as being contributors to the nation’s food, fuel and fiber industries by growing cotton.

“I can’t describe the feeling of working all year and watching that crop grow,” Heffington said as he looked out to the farmland surrounding him. “Then you get to harvest and say ‘I grew that.’ This is what we’re used to, this is our everyday.”

It easy to understand why the farming industry isn’t alluring to some young people. Texas farmers face unique challenges: drought, storms and unpredictable markets. It’s costly to start. Heffington’s first tractor cost $49,000.

A single machinery breakdown can spell the difference between a farmer ending the year flush or in debt.

The young farmers — those 35 and under — who do take this on only account for about 9% of the state’s farms.

Agricultural officials have taken notice of the barriers that could keep young farmers and ranchers out of the business, and have made programs specifically to draw them in.

The Young Farmer Grant program by the Texas Department of Agriculture is open for people 18-46 years old and provides money for creating or expanding a business. The grants can range from $5,000 to $20,000.

“We’ve helped a lot of people get started and we think we get a good return on our investment,” Commissioner Miller said. “Those people just need a little bit of help to get them going.”

Miller also applauded livestock shows across the state that provide scholarships for young people and similar programs, including the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association and the Texas Farm Bureau.

Weems, of the Farm Bureau, said the people interested in their program are a mix of young people coming back to their family farm or newcomers with little experience and a genuine interest in agriculture.

“There’s opportunities for them to work with individuals that are looking at transitioning out or passing that farm on to another generation,” Weems explained. “Agriculture is critical to our survival, so it’s important that young people stay engaged.”

Heffington can name a half dozen farmers around him who have retired since he started farming, but he said he won’t take on any more acres. He likes helping Drake, whose farm is 20 miles away from Heffington’s, but that’s his limit for now.

“I think I’m tapped out on what me and my two employees can do,” Heffington explained. “I’m pretty content where I’m at, but I’m sure that’s going to change one day.”explained. “I’m pretty content where I’m at, but I’m sure that’s going to change one day.”

Heffington is aware of the challenges he will likely face, because he saw it growing up on his dad’s cotton farm. Still, Heffington knows cotton like the back of his hand and wants to make it his future. Like Drake, he sees himself being in the business for a long time.

“I’ll go until I can’t or something happens,” Heffington said. “I can’t see myself doing anything else.”

The same is true for Drake — even in retirement.

In between his morning coffee in Littlefield and driving for afternoon coffee in nearby Sudan, Drake is known to do small things Heffington might need around the farm, and doesn’t hesitate to climb in the tractor.

“I drive out to that farm every day,” Drake admits. “Not only to inspect what Tanner’s doing, but that’s where I’ve been all my life. I just keep driving back out there.”","imate how difficult it can be to hand over a family farm, but Jimmy Drake was lucky to find a suitable successor in Tanner Heffington, a close friend and family member. Together they carry on the proud tradition of Texas farmers and the hard labor that comes with it."

Middlesbrough mayor Chris Cooke has said financial plans for the coming years are ""starting to take shape"" but budget consultations are being delayed.

The Labour mayor said some consultations would be delayed until more is known about the money Middlesbrough Council will get from government. It is hoped the government's Autumn Statement will give more information about this funding.

Council chiefs have said they are trying to transform services rather than ""salami-slicing"" them as they work to plug gaps and overspends totalling £25.7m. The council is facing a predicted £11.5m overspend, a £14.2m budget gap for next year and ""critically low"" reserves amid high inflation and more money spent in areas like children's services, adult social care and home to school transport.

They may also get rid of ""surplus and underused land and property assets"" to make money for the authority. The council has also reference to reviewing and rationalising assets, ""to sell assets in a sensible measured way"" in previous meetings.

Councillor Nicky Walker, executive member for finance and governance, previously said there was ""an incredible amount of work going on behind the scenes"" to address the ""very fragile position"", with saving measures worth £2.5m already identified. Council meetings have been told of difficult decisions to be made with ""very little wiggle room"", savings to be proposed and services to be ""transformed"" at a time of uncertainty with the economy, energy costs, pay and government funding.

At a full council meeting on Wednesday evening (October 25), Mr Cooke said: ""No one is under any false pretences that the council does face incredibly difficult times. We have inherited an incredibly difficult reserves position and we are currently working incredibly hard to make sure that this year's budget falls within the spending limit.

""But also that we can come up with a plan not just for next year but for the consecutive three years. The plans are all starting to take shape.

""But there's been a need to delay some of the budgetary consultation periods. We're doing this until after the Autumn Statement which will give us a more clear indication of what the spending allocation could look like.

""This has been a very challenging time and has taken up a considerable amount of my time, but also the exec's time.""

On council assets, regeneration executive member Cllr Theo Furness says in his latest report: ""The council are looking at all the property and land that is within its ownership and looking to be more strategic and focused in what we do.

""The process will identify surplus and underused council land and property assets and the exercise will focus on how an evolving council structure can deliver effective services from fewer or more accessible sites. As a consequence of this exercise, it is highly likely that surplus land and assets will be identified for disposal.

""Income form asset disposals will support the council’s transformation programme and will provide critical finances to support the authority’s challenging financial position.""

Cllr Morgan McClintock said the framework of the Local Plan setting out the future vision for the town, ""one of the most important roles we undertake"", should be agreed before funding options. He said: ""My concern is that the executive and officers might be getting into such details as land sales and housing developments before we as a council have established our shared vision.""

He asked for assurances about the full council being consulted on the fundamentals. Cllr Furness replied: ""The asset review is underway. The reason why we're doing asset review is the financial position of the council.

""We're starting to rethink what we do as a council. It is much-needed and good practice to review the assets we have.

""That's the reason we pushed back the decision on the Local Plan for consultation. We've pushed it back to December.

""The Local Plan itself is not decided with this decision. It goes to public consultation, then the full council decides on that. The public consultation's actually going to happen over January and February.

""The Local Plan is one of the most important documents as a council that could change the lives of people in Middlesbrough. We've actually made a decision to make it a priority."""," identifying opportunities to utilise the assets to create income.""Middlesbrough Mayor Chris Cooke has revealed that the council is working on financial plans for the coming years, and is delaying budget consultations until more is known about the money the council will receive from the government. The council is also looking to make money by selling surplus and underused land and property assets."

Erie County is not immune either, which is why its draft Community Climate Action Plan lists heavier rainfall events as one of its four principal risks of climate change. FEMA, too, has taken notice, designating 61 new areas of the county as flood prone. In June, a Dartmouth College study concluded that extreme precipitation in the northeast has increased dramatically over the past 30 years and, assuming heat trapping pollution trends continue, will increase 52% further by 2099.

Fortunately, in September, legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives that will combat climate change while investing directly in American communities: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICDA, HR 5744). The Act aims to greatly reduce the heat-trapping pollution that’s changing our weather. It would charge fossil fuel companies for their carbon pollution, thus increasing the economic advantages of clean energy (and products made with it) and accelerating the shift towards a cleaner economy.

The revenue from this carbon fee would be returned to all Americans; another study found that, because low- and middle-income households pollute less, their cashback checks would be larger than their increased energy bills, so they’d come out ahead. Yet another study estimated that an EICDA-sized carbon cashback would lift 1.6 million Americans out of poverty within five years.

It might sound too good to be true, but similar plans have worked in other jurisdictions. Upstate New York municipalities across the political spectrum support this approach. And nonpartisan citizen groups are educating about it. I encourage concerned citizens to learn more, and to urge Representatives Higgins, Langworthy and Tenny to support the EICDA. Our shared future depends on finding wise solutions together.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Detroit auto strike: What is in the UAW contracts with Ford ... - Fortune,https://fortune.com/2023/10/29/what-in-uaw-contract-ford-stellantis-40-per-hour-wage-pay-increase/?ref=biztoc.com,"The United Auto Workers union agreed on tentative new contracts with Ford Motor Co. on Oct. 25, 2023, and Stellantis, the global automaker that makes Chrysler, Dodge and Ram vehicles in North America, on Oct. 28. The tentative deals halted a six-week strike that remains in place for General Motors. The strike, the industry’s longest in 25 years, began on Sept. 15, when the UAW’s prior contracts with all three automakers expired.

Ford released a statement in which it said it was “pleased” to have reached a deal and “focused on restarting Kentucky Truck Plant, Michigan Assembly Plant and Chicago Assembly Plant.” Stellantis, likewise, looks forward to “resuming operations,” one of its executives said in a statement.

The Conversation asked Marick Masters, a Wayne State University scholar of labor and business issues, to explain what’s in these contracts and their significance.

What are the terms of the contract?

According to several media reports and the union’s own announcements, Ford’s tentative labor agreement includes a 25% wage increase over the next 4 ½ years, as well as the restoration of a cost-of-living allowance the UAW lost in 2009.

In addition, the tentative agreement also will convert many temporary workers to full-time status, higher pay for temps in general, the right to go on strike over plant closures, and significant increases in Ford’s contributions to its defined-contribution retirement plans.

By the end of the Ford and Stellantis contracts, the top worker wage at assembly plants will be more than $40 an hour. Both will expire on April 30, 2028.

The Stellantis deal, according to UAW officials, is similar to the one reached with Ford in other ways too – as, reportedly, is the one that the UAW has nearly wrapped up with GM.

The Stellantis agreement also has provisions regarding specific North American plants, including the plant Stellantis had idled earlier in 2023 in Belvidere, Illinois, the UAW said. Stellantis has promised to add 5,000 new jobs at Belvidere and other factories over the next four years, in stark contrast to its previous intention to cut that many jobs during the same period, UAW President Shawn Fain said on Oct. 28.

Why did workers feel the strike was necessary, and did it achieve their aims?

The workers knew that the companies had enjoyed big profits over the past several years. GM, for example, earned $10 billion in profits in 2021 and $14.5 billion in 2022.

After having made major economic concessions to help the companies survive the Great Recession, stiff international competition and the 2009 bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler – before the latter became a division of Stellantis – UAW members believed they deserved what they’re calling a “record contract” for having contributed to “record profits.”

“The days of low-wage, unstable jobs at the Big Three are coming to an end,” Fain said on Oct. 28. “The days of the Big Three walking away from the American working class, destroying our communities, are coming to an end.”

To forge its militant strategy, the union tore a page from the playbook of labor leader Walter Reuther, who led the UAW from 1946 until his death in 1970. Reuther believed that workers deserved a fair share of corporate abundance – just like shareholders and customers.

What happens next?

The UAW will release the full details of the Ford contract to all of its members who are Ford workers on Oct. 29, as long as its leaders beyond the negotiating team sign off on it that day. After that, rank-and-file members will have to ratify the deal for it to go into effect.

The same process will happen with Stellantis on Nov. 2. The separate deal with GM that the UAW is still negotiating will also require ratification.

In the meantime, Ford and Stellantis workers who went on strike will be returning to their jobs as factories and other facilities resume operations. About 18,000 GM workers are still on strike.

How will this affect the automakers’ bottom line?

Some analysts have estimated that Ford’s contract, if ratified, would add $1.5 billion to the company’s annual labor costs. Ford itself estimated that this could add up to $900 in labor costs to each vehicle rolling off its assembly lines. Ford has also estimated that the strike cost it about $1.3 billion in pretax profits.

To put these numbers into perspective, Ford generated slightly more than $130 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023, and almost $5 billion in profits.

Stellantis has not yet made public what it believes the strike has cost the company.

About a year and a half later, the Georgia resident says, he was in a “vicious cycle” of borrowing from several similar apps to cover bills and other regular expenses. The apps took the majority of each paycheck for repayment before he even saw it, Smith says.

Recent research from consumer and government organizations suggests the debt cycle Smith fell into may be common for users of cash advance apps, also known as paycheck advance apps. As inflation keeps everyday costs like groceries high, consumer advocates and financial experts warn against relying on services that promise fast cash advances and recommend seeking other ways to cover your expenses.

How paycheck advance apps work

Paycheck advance apps provide small advances of a few hundred dollars or less and take repayment directly from users’ bank accounts on their next payday.

Instead of a credit check, the apps typically review borrowers’ connected bank accounts to determine their advance limit and repayment date.

Though the apps review users’ transactions, there don’t appear to be safeguards that prevent borrowing from multiple apps at once, says Andrew Kushner, senior policy counsel with the Center for Responsible Lending.

The apps often ask for tips and optional express fees that reduce funding time from a few business days to a few hours or less — a significant difference for cash-strapped borrowers.

Are cash advance apps the same as payday loans?

Cash advance apps are similar to payday loans, but they’re not exactly the same. Their fees are often lower and mostly optional, and advance amounts are usually smaller than payday loans.

Regulatory agencies don’t currently categorize these apps as lenders, meaning they don’t have to follow common lending laws like the Truth in Lending Act, which guarantees certain consumer protections.

But Kushner says the apps function as smaller payday loans that borrowers can get more frequently.

On average, cash advance app users borrowed 26 to 33 times per year between 2019 and 2021, according to a March report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The average payday loan borrower takes out about eight loans per year, a 2012 study from The Pew Charitable Trusts found.

“If you take more of them, what you’ve really done is just broken up a payday loan cycle into much smaller, more frequent direct-to-consumer advances,” Kushner says.

How one-time borrowing becomes a debt cycle

Smith intended to have one night of fun when he downloaded EarnIn, but he worked unpredictable hours at the time so he also got advances to bridge income gaps.

When he was most reliant on cash advance apps, Smith says, most of his paycheck would be gone from his bank account before he even saw it. Then, he had to claw back funds by taking advances from seven or eight apps — a cycle he repeated each pay period.

“It just went completely out of control, and I was having to live off the borrowing apps,” he says.

In August 2023, the Center for Responsible Lending reported its survey results showing that most users borrowed from an app one or two times per week in a typical month, and 24% of users borrowed from multiple apps regularly.

“I think that’s indicative that people are falling into a debt trap,” Kushner says. “They’re basically having to keep borrowing and paying these fees just to get back to where they were beforehand.”

Small fees add up

Smith wasn’t just getting part of his paycheck early, but also losing money by paying fees for the advances.

Most companies that provide cash advances reject comparisons to traditional lenders, but to understand the cost of an advance, it’s helpful to look through the lens of a loan.

Let’s say you use a cash advance app to borrow $200 today. The app charges a $7 express fee to get the money in a few hours instead of two or three business days. The app also asks for a tip. Some paycheck advance companies say users tip $1 on average, so add that to the total.

You’ve paid $8 to borrow $200. If your paycheck comes in seven days, that fee would equate to a 208.6% annual percentage rate — much higher than the 36% maximum APR consumer advocates recommend on small loans.

“The fees seem very low at the time, but they stack up,” Smith says. “It gets out of control fast. I think that’s what people don’t realize with those apps.”

Alternatives to cash advance apps

It’s possible to use a cash advance app without sliding into a debt cycle, says Brandy Baxter, a Dallas-area accredited financial counselor (AFC) who studies trends in financial services.

The key is to borrow money only when you know you can repay it, she says. But for people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, that’s easier said than done.

“When you’re an hourly employee, anything can happen between the day you took the loan and the day that it is due,” she says. “The mobile app is going to debit your account no matter what. They don’t care that you didn’t work the hours you thought you were going to work.”

Here are some borrowing alternatives Baxter recommends.

Find other ways to make money. Look for another income source, like selling old clothes or doing extra work online. It may not be easy to find the time for a side gig, especially for working parents, so Baxter recommends thinking of things you already do — cooking, watching kids — that you could charge for.

Get on a payment plan. If you’re hit with an unexpected expense, ask about a payment plan. Physicians, veterinarians and auto repair shops may offer an interest-free payment plan or work with a “buy now, pay later” company to split up large expenses.

Consult a financial counselor. The Association for Financial Counseling & Planning Education has a network of counselors who can review your cash flow and make a plan to work toward your financial goals, Baxter says. Ask about costs upfront: Some AFCs charge a fee for their services, but those who work for a nonprofit may not.","____ to get a $100 advance that you repay in two weeks. That’s an annual percentage rate of about 400% — far higher than the average credit card interest rate of 17.4%.Consumer advocates and financial experts recommend using alternatives such as budgeting apps, emergency funds or credit cards to cover expenses.Cash advance apps provide small advances of a few hundred dollars or less and take repayment directly from users' bank accounts on their next payday, often with fees of up to 400% APR. Research from consumer and government organizations suggests this can create a debt cycle, as users take out multiple advances each pay period and lose part of their paycheck to fees. Consumer advocates and financial experts recommend alternative methods to cover expenses."

Stellantis and the United Auto Workers have reached a tentative agreement that, if approved, will bring pay raises, improved benefits and most importantly for Illinois, a new vehicle and an EV battery plant to Belvidere.

The tentative agreement, announced Saturday by the UAW, includes a 25% increase in base wages, cost of living adjustments and the right to strike over plant closures, mirroring a similar deal struck by Ford on Wednesday. But the Stellantis agreement also would restart the 60-year-old Belvidere Assembly Plant, which has been idled since February.

As part of the deal, the Belvidere plant will get both an unnamed vehicle and an adjacent battery manufacturing facility, bringing thousands of jobs back to the small river city near Rockford. The state recently optioned a large parcel of land next to the 280-acre Belvidere plant to accommodate manufacturing expansion.

“Through the power of our Stand Up Strike, we have saved Belvidere,” UAW Vice President Rich Boyer said in a news release. “Stellantis is reopening the plant and the company will also be adding over a thousand jobs at a new battery plant in Belvidere.”

Sources said the Belvidere plant may become home to a light truck, a battery plant and a parts distribution center. The new vehicle to be built at Belvidere would likely be electric, sources said.

Stellantis did not comment on the specifics of the Belvidere agreement.

“I look forward to finalizing the state’s economic package and not only reopening the shuttered assembly plant in Belvidere to manufacture electric vehicles, but also co-locating a new battery production facility,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release. “This will be thousands of jobs, billions in investment, and a huge win for Illinois.”

In February, Stellantis “indefinitely” idled the assembly plant and laid off its last 1,200 workers after halting production of the Jeep Cherokee amid dwindling sales. Since then, the fate of the plant has been a source of industry speculation and a focus for legislators seeking to either convince Stellantis to reopen it or find someone else to move in.

The plant’s future became a pivotal negotiating point during the six-week UAW strike, with everything from a “megahub” parts distribution center to a battery plant on the table. The agreement seems to incorporate all of the above, an outcome that was met with enthusiasm in Belvidere.

“We go from pretty much dead in the water to potentially one of the biggest locals in the corporation,” said Matt Frantzen, head of UAW Local 1268 at the idled Stellantis plant in Belvidere. “It’s going to be pretty exciting for the Belvidere, Boone County area.”

For nearly six decades, the massive auto plant has been the economic engine of Belvidere, churning out everything from the Plymouth Fury and the Chrysler New Yorker to the Dodge Dart.

The Belvidere plant became the exclusive home for the Jeep Cherokee in 2017. The region’s largest employer at its zenith, the plant had 5,464 workers on three shifts at the start of 2019, after building 270,000 of the SUVs during the previous year. The third shift was eliminated in 2019, downsizing 1,400 workers out of their jobs.

The state put together a number of incentive packages to get Stellantis to bring some form of EV production to the idled plant. The Invest in Illinois Act created a $400 million “closing fund” to incentivize EV manufacturers and other businesses to locate, expand or remain in the state through favorable financing. The 2021 Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act was bolstered in December, upping the incentive to 75% of state income tax for automakers that retain employees as they transition to EV production.

U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, a Democrat whose 11th Congressional District includes Belvidere, said getting Stellantis to restart the assembly plant has been “all hands on deck effort” at every level of government.

“It’s been the heart and soul of Belvidere for generations and when the plant was idled earlier this year, it sort of felt like something big was missing,” Foster said Saturday. “Since the start of the year ... this was job one, to do everything we can to provide a future.”

The UAW, which represents 146,000 members across the U.S., is seeking a new four-year labor agreement with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Demands include pay increases, shorter workweeks and improvements to retiree pensions and health care plans amid record profits for the Big Three automakers.

When the previous contract expired on Sept. 15, the UAW launched a strike against all three automakers for the first time in the Detroit-based union’s 88-year history. The strike expanded to nearly 45,000 UAW members at eight assembly plants and 38 parts distribution centers in 22 states.

After nearly six weeks of striking, the UAW reached a tentative agreement with Ford Wednesday. The automaker said nearly 20,000 employees will return to their jobs in the coming days while the agreement goes through the ratification process, including 4,613 autoworkers at the Chicago Assembly Plant on the city’s Southeast Side.

With the tentative agreement Saturday, thousands of Stellantis workers will also get the call to return, the automaker said Saturday.

“We look forward to welcoming our 43,000 employees back to work and resuming operations to serve our customers and execute our Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to maintain Stellantis’ position at the forefront of innovation,” Mark Stewart, North American COO of Stellantis, said in a statement.

The strike continues against GM, the UAW said Saturday.

“Two cities are subsiding the entire rest of the bank,” wrote Mr Zeno Toulon in a piece for efinancialcareers.com, a leading global financial services careers website published on Friday (Oct 27), after saying that this is something that many have observed for some time now. The writer also called Singapore and Hong Kong Standard Charter’s money makers “by some margin.”

He noted that in spite of Standard Chartered’s bankers in the two cities only employing less than 39 per cent of the bank’s capital, combined, 79 per cent of the bank’s underlying profit came from Singapore and Hong Kong.

The two cities, plus Taiwan and the UAE, have performed the most efficiently when it comes to Return on tangible equity (ROTE), and also have the the lowest cost-income ratios. ROTE, which is a company’s profit post-tax, divided by tangible equity, has long been a benchmark of profitability and performance.

On the other end of the scale is Standard Charter UK, which has lost money for the bank. Though it employs nearly twenty-five per cent of Standard Chartered’s assets, it posted a loss of almost US$200 million (S$274 million), as well as wrote off almost $700m (S$959 million), in relation to its position in local retail Bohai Bank. The bank remains optimistic about its business prospects in China, Mr Toulon added.

And while the world’s second largest economy has been going through tough times, the opposite is true of Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, which has had a very good year so far.

For people considering a career in finance or are already in it and are wondering which finance hub is a better choice, there are a few factors to consider. A recent piece in Bloomberg pointed out that Singapore, “the Switzerland of Asia,” has been attracting an influx of wealth from overseas.

Funds overseen by the asset management industry have grown to twice its size in six years and are now at around $4 trillion (S$5.45 trillion). High-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals have been drawn by political and economic stability and low-income tax rates in Singapore, and industry experts are saying the inflow is unlikely to stop anytime soon.

Strict COVID-19 restrictions and fears of restrictions from Beijing even drove a considerable number of finance workers from Hong Kong to Singapore during the early years of the pandemic. Still, some have started to go back to Hong Kong since then, Bloomberg reported.

Nevertheless, Hong Kong has kept its edge as Asia’s top financial centre, given its relation to China, the second-largest global economy. Hong Kong has the advantage of proximity to China’s US$18 trillion (S$24.5 trillion) economy, compared to Singapore’s relationship to countries in South East Asia, with a combined US$3 trillion (S$4.1 trillion) economy. Small wonder that nearly half of Asia’s hedge fund managers are based in Hong Kong. /TISG","Standard Chartered's third-quarter results show that 79 per cent of their profits come from Singapore and Hong Kong, with the two cities employing less than 39 per cent of the bank's capital.

Retirement often feels like a far-off dream for busy entrepreneurs. You’re so focused on the day-to-day demands of running a business that planning for your eventual exit seems like a luxury you can’t afford.

But ignoring retirement planning is a risky gamble that could leave you financially unprepared when you decide to transition out of your business. The key is leveraging your small business proactively to maximize your nest egg.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore various strategies to help business owners like you retire comfortably:

Why retirement planning is critical for entrepreneurs

Tax-advantaged accounts to turbocharge retirement savings

Building passive income streams into your business

Preparing your business for a smooth succession

And much more

Arm yourself with the knowledge you need to leverage your small business for a secure retirement future. The time to start planning is now.

Why Retirement Planning Matters for Small Business Owners

Building a business from scratch requires tremendous sacrifice. Long hours, financial risk, non-stop stress—it’s the price we pay to follow our dreams.

But will all those sacrifices pay off down the road when you’re ready to retire? Or will you still be chained to your small business, unable to leave without sinking into poverty?

Unfortunately, too many entrepreneurs reach retirement age without adequate savings. They become forced to work well past 65 just to make ends meet.

Don’t let that happen to you. With some planning and business-oriented money-saving tips now, you can leverage your business to retire comfortably instead of reluctantly slaving away.

Here are powerful reasons to prioritize retirement planning today:

Enjoy a Bigger Nest Egg

Saving for retirement is a challenge for any working adult. But as a small business owner, you have advantages.

Retirement accounts like SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s allow much higher contribution limits compared to conventional plans, while staying organized and keeping track of your contacts can also contribute to a successful retirement plan.

Funding these accounts now supercharges your retirement savings. For example, in 2023 you can contribute up to $22,500 to a Solo 401(k), plus up to 25% of your compensation. That’s huge!

With consistent contributions at those levels, your retirement savings can snowball into a sizable nest egg.

Reduce Your Tax Burden

As a small business owner, you get hammered by taxes. Self-employment taxes, income taxes, payroll taxes—it never ends.

But tax-advantaged retirement accounts offer a legal way to lower your taxable income. Money you contribute isn’t taxed until you withdraw it in retirement.

That tax break leaves more money in your pocket today. And your investments grow tax-free for decades, ultimately reducing your lifetime tax burden.

Attract and Retain Talent

Does your small business have employees? Offering a quality retirement plan can help attract and retain top talent.

Workers today expect good benefits. And retirement plans give you a competitive edge in hiring.

Plus, when key employees do eventually retire, you’ll need a succession plan in place. Retirement accounts help facilitate smooth transitions.

Enjoy Peace of Mind

Above all, retirement planning gives you peace of mind. You can rest easy knowing your business is set up to provide long-term financial security.

No more stressing about how you’ll pay the bills after retiring. No more working yourself to the bone into your 70s.

With a well-funded retirement plan and a solid understanding of up-to-date small business statistics, you can confidently leave your business on your own terms.

Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts for Entrepreneurs

Okay, you’re convinced retirement planning is imperative. But where do you start?

For small business owners, the most powerful savings tool is a tax-advantaged retirement account. Options like SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and Solo 401(k)s allow you to save far more than conventional plans.

Let’s compare the pros and cons of each so you can make the best choice.

SEP IRA

A SEP IRA, short for Simplified Employee Pension, is a special retirement account for small business owners and self-employed folks.

Pros of a SEP IRA:

Easy to set up and administer

Allows high annual contributions

All contributions are tax deductible

Only employer makes contributions

Cons of a SEP IRA:

Limited to employer contributions only

No catch-up contributions if over 50

Must include all employees in plan

With a SEP IRA, in 2023 you can contribute up to 25% of compensation or $22,500 per year, whichever is less. This allows substantial tax-advantaged savings.

A SEP is also easy to establish at nearly any bank or brokerage. Just fill out some forms and you’re ready to start contributing. Use this guide from the IRS to learn more.

SIMPLE IRA

The SIMPLE IRA is another retirement plan designed for small businesses. SIMPLE stands for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees. It’s a retirement plan for small businesses with 100 or fewer employees.

Pros:

Easy to set up and administer

Employer matching contributions required

Participants can contribute up to $15,500 in 2023

Cons:

Limited investment options

Mandatory employer match can be costly

Only available to companies with 100 or fewer employees

With a SIMPLE IRA, employees can contribute a percentage of their salary each pay period. Employers are required to make either:

A matching contribution up to 3% of compensation

Or

A 2% non-elective contribution for all eligible employees

Check out this SIMPLE IRA guide to learn more about the requirements and rules.

Solo 401(k)

The Solo 401(k) is a retirement account targeted to self-employed individuals and small business owners with no full-time W-2 employees (except a spouse).

Pros:

Allows very high contribution limits

Can make both employee and employer contributions

Loans allowed from the plan

Roth contributions permitted

Cons:

More complex to administer than SEP or SIMPLE IRA

Annual IRS filings required

Trustee fees can be high

In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 as an employee, plus up to 25% of compensation as an employer (max $66,000 total). Solo 401(k)s offer tremendous tax-advantaged savings potential.

Learn more in this Solo 401(k) guide from the IRS.

Generating Passive Income from Your Small Business

In addition to leveraging tax-advantaged accounts, smart entrepreneurs generate ongoing passive revenue streams that will continue paying out during retirement.

Here are a few ways to transform your small business into a passive income machine:

License Your Intellectual Property

Do you have proprietary products, software, or technology? Consider licensing your intellectual property (IP) to other companies for an ongoing royalty fee.

For example, you could license your software as a service (SaaS) product to other businesses in exchange for 5% in royalties. Or license your patented technology to manufacturers for a 2% cut of sales.

Licensing converts your IP into a lifetime revenue stream with minimal effort on your part. Just collect those recurring royalty checks year after year.

Franchise Your Business

One of the fastest ways to scale up passive income is franchising your small business. This allows you to open up hundreds of locations nationally or globally while collecting an upfront franchise fee and ongoing royalty payments.

For instance, a franchise fee of $25,000 per location plus 5% royalties creates significant cashflow with minimal day-to-day involvement. Franchising is complex but can be very lucrative.

Invest in Income-Producing Assets

Use your business profits to invest in assets that produce ongoing income, like dividend stocks, rental properties, or peer-to-peer lending platforms.

The key is picking investments that generate cashflow with minimal maintenance and management on your part. Then reinvest the payouts for compound growth.

Preparing Your Small Business for a Smooth Transition

The final piece of the retirement puzzle is readying your business for a successful transition once you’re ready to sell or pass the baton.

Proper succession planning ensures your business continues to thrive in your absence, keeping its value high. It also paves the way for a smooth leadership transition.

Here are some tips:

Groom Your Successor

Identify a successor and groom them years in advance. Train them to eventually take over your role. This retains business knowledge and ensures uninterrupted leadership.

Create a Transition Plan

Outline a detailed transition plan for handing off ownership, management, and strategic direction. Set clear timelines for the new leadership takeover.

Address Legal and Financial Issues

Consult lawyers and accountants to tie up any loose ends around the company’s legal structure, ownership equity, valuation, taxes, and accounting.

Communicate with Employees and Customers

Be transparent about the transition and maintain trust. Assure employees and customers it’s “business as usual” under the new leadership.

With the right succession strategies, you can transition out on your own terms while keeping your business running smoothly without you.

Start Planning Your Small Business-Funded Retirement Now

Retirement may feel distant, but the time to start planning is now.

With the strategies we’ve covered today—tax-advantaged accounts, passive income streams, succession planning—you have a blueprint for leveraging your small business to retire comfortably.

No more fretting and uncertainty about how you’ll afford to leave your business. You’re equipped with actionable steps to lock in financial security for your later years.

The key is taking that first step:

Set up a Solo 401(k) or other retirement account ASAP

Explore passive income ideas that fit your business

Map out a transition plan for the future

Small, consistent actions today will compound into huge rewards down the road. You’ve worked hard to build this business. Make sure it takes care of you well into retirement.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Homebuilders Feel the Squeeze of Tight Housing Market,https://www.thedailyupside.com/finance/markets/homebuilders-feel-the-squeeze-of-tight-housing-market/,"It’s a vicious cycle that’s causing extra pain for millennials. They can’t crack the housing market because of high prices that reflect a nationwide housing shortage. But home builders can’t build homes because materials and loans cost more.

Shares of leading US homebuilders have plummeted since an industry-wide peak in July, according to a Financial Times analysis, when rising mortgage rates convinced existing homeowners to sit tight and spurred prospective homeowners to opt for newly built homes instead. Now, inflation and demand have caught up to put the pinch on that corner of the housing market as well.

Full House-ing Market

Mortgage rates last week hit the highest point of any time this side of the Y2K panic, according to Freddie Mac, hitting 7.79% after starting the year at 6.48% (moping millennial and Gen Z relatives can be glad adulthood began after the early ‘90s, when that surpassed 10%). Still, applications for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell last week to the lowest point since 1995, according to the FT. And it seems the new-home miniboom from late summer is finally going bust.

As existing home sales in September fell to their lowest levels since 2010, new home sales lept over 12% month-over-month, according to the Census Bureau, and construction starts on new single-family homes increased by 9%. But by October, the new home high was short-lived, with continued inflation ballooning construction costs and sending homebuilding confidence to its lowest point of the year, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

And perhaps nobody felt the wild swings in sentiment more than homebuilders. Or, more accurately, shareholders in major homebuilding companies:

After a peak in July, major homebuilders Lennar, DR Horton, and NVR have each seen their stocks drop by more than 16%.

Meanwhile, PulteGroup has seen a similar 16% drop following an 86% year-to-date surge through August that sent its share price to an all-time high of nearly $85.

“Builders won’t have an incentive to break ground on new projects so long as demand remains subdued, and we don’t see a sustained turnaround until credit becomes less restrictive and affordability improves,” Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, told the FT.

Sweet Relief: Getting into the housing market may just be a waiting game now for prospective homebuyers. The National Association of Realtors expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to fall back down to 6% by the end of 2024, which was echoed in a Goldman Sachs research note from last week predicting rates will fall below 7% by the end of next year. But that may quickly be offset. Home prices, already up some 26% since 2020, are expected to increase by nearly 5% next year, Zillow predicts.","Millennials are struggling to crack the housing market due to high prices resulting from a nationwide housing shortage. Home builders are unable to build homes due to high materials and loan costs, causing major homebuilding companies' stocks to drop 16% since July. Mortgage rates have hit their highest point in decades, yet applications for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have fallen to the lowest point since 1995. Prices are expected to increase by 5% in 2021, making it harder for millennials to enter the market."

The former president on Saturday took to his social media platform to attack“Trump-hating” Judge Arthur Engoron a day after he issued a ruling ordering Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, to testify in the case.

“I truly believe he is CRAZY, but certainly, at a minimum, CRAZED in his hatred of me,” Trump said of Engoron, writing in a caps-filled message shared on Truth Social.

In June, an appeals court dismissed Ivanka as a defendant in the lawsuit, which was brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Her attorneys argued she hadn’t worked for the Trump Organization since 2017 and the claims against her were too old.

She was released “from this Fake Letitia James case” by the court of appeals, Trump wrote, but this “unhinged Judge, who ruled me guilty before this Witch Hunt Trial even started, couldn’t care less about the fact that he was overturned.”

The twice-impeached president continued to unleash his fury on Engoron, calling him an “out of control ‘Nut Job’ (judge) who fined me $10,000 over a ridiculous Gag Order so that the publicity for the day would take over from the fact that Racist James and the Judge’s Star Witness admitted LYING TO CONGRESS on the stand — CASE OVER!”

On Wednesday, Trump was put on the witness stand and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order. The dramatic scene came just days after Engoron ordered the former president to pay a $5,000 fine for posting incendiary comments about the judge’s chief law clerk, Allison Greenfield.

Later on Saturday, Trump once again attacked “this grossly incompetent ‘Judge,’ who is overturned on Appeal more than almost any Judge in New York State,” he wrote on Truth Social. “(He) is a partisan political hack who totally disregards the Court of Appeals.”","Donald Trump has lashed out at the Manhattan judge presiding over his civil fraud trial, calling him ""crazy"" and a ""Nut Job"" while accusing him of being overturned on appeal more than any other judge in New York.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,here’s why you shouldn’t trust Copilot - Laptop Mag,https://www.laptopmag.com/software/microsoft-has-an-ad-problem-heres-why-you-shouldnt-trust-copilot,"Microsoft unveiled plans for its own AI a month ago, similar to so many other companies nowadays. It’s affectionately titled “Copilot,” implying it will be your right-hand robot throughout many a task, especially while using Microsoft’s 365 suite. But earlier this month, we learned that Microsoft will be integrating ads into Copilot .

Beyond this affirming my skepticism in regards to AI technologies, it made me realize something: Microsoft has a serious advertisement issue. We’ve previously covered ways to block every last ad found on Windows 11 , but there’s more to this than just looking for fixes. We don’t think you should trust Copilot, and as soon as it launches on November 1st, we recommend removing it.

Ads in Windows 11

While this wasn’t as big of an issue with previous iterations of Windows, the company has gone above and beyond in automatically installing software into its systems. Applications like Spotify, LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok and more can magically find their way onto your hard drive when you begin your Windows 11 journey.

Beyond that, Windows is no stranger to shilling for itself. One of the most frustrating culprits in this regard is OneDrive, a feature that has no shame in shoving itself down your throat at every opportunity. It gets so bad that the company will try to have you save files through an automatic backup folder. I have been perplexed when told that my OneDrive is full, only to see files in there that I never wanted. The trick here is that Windows wants us to use OneDrive so it can bother us about needing more storage to accommodate all of those items you totally chose to backup. And of course, that costs money. Classic shameless advertising.

(Image credit: Windows)

And to add fuel to the fire, while writing this section of this very article, a OneDrive notification was abruptly tossed onto the right side of my screen, saying “Get to your files from anywhere.” I finally decided to just uninstall OneDrive.

This reminds me of the issues I’ve had with the Xbox App, where points notifications would show while I’m just trying to play games. I previously wrote how to turn off Xbox points notifications , but the specifics of this are perplexing. You cannot turn them off through the Xbox App itself. You have to use Xbox Game Bar, meaning the two apps have separate settings. It might be a bit of stretch to say that this is an advertisement, but considering this revolves around Xbox’s Rewards program, I would argue that it still is an ad.

Ads in Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge is a nightmare. Like all of my coworkers, I’ve come to possess a somewhat unique experience in regards to Microsoft Edge. When I first open up a laptop for review, I have the choice to either perform some of my tests by traveling to various websites on Microsoft Edge, or take the time to download Chrome. There are some days where I don’t have the energy to go download Chrome, so I just stick with Edge. But I always regret it.

(Image credit: Windows)

In the image above, I opened Microsoft Edge before being bombarded with a cluttered advertisement regarding the “productivity” and “creativity” found in Copilot. It’s somewhat hilarious timing, considering Copilot is what sparked this frustrated tirade to begin with. Also, an Origin PC tab opened up for some reason. That one confused me, so I tried launching Microsoft Edge again, and it brought me back to Origin PC. I have no clue how that happened, but it seems at some point, Origin PC became my home page on the browser I never use.

(Image credit: Windows)

Even if I were to give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt and criticize them exclusively based on their homepage, it’s equally dreadful. “This $49 Device gives Foot a Second Life for Seniors?” What is going on? Why is this being shown to me as soon as I open Microsoft Edge? And Microsoft has the gall to tell us that Edge is its “recommended browser” when it's set on thrusting ads in our face even on its homepage.

It’s content overload, and I wouldn’t trust half of the sites on here. Yet when you search “Google Chrome” through Edge, an advertisement pops up saying “Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Edge for a fast, secure, and modern web experience that can help save you time and money.” I don’t want to give myself a virus just to test it out, but I don’t think anyone is safe clicking on an advertisement about a $49 “device” that gives “foot” a “second life” for “seniors.”

(Image credit: Windows)

Comparatively, launching Google Chrome yields a simple tab that showcases the things I actually need. This looks similar to the default for any Google Chrome user. I didn’t have to go out of my way to turn things off, and all it shows me are my bookmarks and my nine most frequently visited pages. I’m not going to sit here and pretend Google is victimless in the world of advertisements, but it’s a step up from Microsoft.

Why this is a problem for Microsoft Copilot

With everything shown here thus far, we’re expected to believe that Microsoft Copilot should be allowed to advertise to us? The same company that just gave me an advertisement titled “This $49 Device gives Foot a Second Life for Seniors” wants us to trust it in providing well-founded recommendations? Alongside the company’s poor history of over advertising its own software, why would anyone want Microsoft to handle this?

(Image credit: Microsoft)

I think back to every time I’ve tried to download Google Chrome on Edge only for Microsoft to tell me that its browser is the best around. And for every moment I’ve been overwhelmed by advertisements for OneDrive or Microsoft 365, especially when going through that first-time setup screen on any Windows device, where the company tries to sell its numerous applications to the user. Why wouldn’t we expect Copilot to do the same?

Bottom line

Copilot will have Microsoft’s interests at heart. That’s not a surprise, as it is funded and created by the company. But imagine a scenario where your co-pilot while flying a plane constantly yaps in your ear about OneDrive, Microsoft Edge, the 365 Suite, or a $49 device that gives “Foot a Second Life for Seniors.”

If a significant group of people genuinely come to trust Copilot as their companion throughout the internet, and one of those individuals were to ask “what’s the safest browser I can download,” will Copilot say anything except Edge? If I’m looking for a good laptop, a powerful console, great games, the best apps, or backup services, why wouldn’t it just recommend the things Microsoft owns?

I don’t want my co-pilot to be a corporate fueled advertisement machine. But like any of the wonderful features Microsoft introduces on Windows, the only reasonable solution is to remove it. Microsoft Copilot launches for enterprise customers on November 1, and personally, I will be uninstalling it as soon as possible. Feel free to dip your toes in the water, but don’t let Copilot drown you (in advertisements).","rowned” browser?Microsoft has unveiled plans for its AI technology, Copilot, and has revealed it will include ads. Microsoft has a history of implementing ads into its Windows 11 software and Edge browser, making it difficult for users to trust Copilot. Microsoft's ads can be found on the homepage, in applications, and in notifications, making it difficult for users to navigate the software without being bombarded by ads."

He still hasn't posted a hitless game. (Photo by Mary DeCicco/MLB Photos via Getty Images)

The Arizona Diamondbacks are on the board in the 2023 World Series, with Ketel Marte picking up some major history in the process.

The D-backs second baseman extended his postseason hitting streak to 18 games Saturday in Game 2 against the Texas Rangers, breaking a tie with Derek Jeter, Manny Ramirez and Hank Bauer for the MLB record for the longest hitting streak in playoff history.

The hit was a two-out RBI single to center in the eighth that expanded Arizona's lead to 6-1. The D-backs won 9-1 to even the series 1-1.

Ketel Marte's 18-game postseason hitting streak dates back to 2017 and is now the longest in MLB history! #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/TNDcggQXk1 — MLB (@MLB) October 29, 2023

Marte's hitting streak covers his entire 18-game postseason career, which dates to his first postseason appearance with the D-backs in 2017. He is currently hitting .350/.366/.613 in 82 plate appearances in the 2023 playoffs.

Marte is the longest-tenured player on Arizona's roster, having joined the team ahead of the 2017 season in a trade with the Seattle Mariners involving Taijuan Walker, Jean Segura and Mitch Haniger. He has quietly been one of the best second basemen in baseball since reaching the desert, hitting .282/.352/.478 (121 OPS+) with the Diamondbacks.

The D-backs have made plenty of use of Marte this postseason, alternating him with likely NL Rookie of the Year Corbin Carroll as the 1-2 punch at the top of their lineup.", Marte's 18-game postseason hitting streak is the longest in MLB history.
2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Four candidates for three commissioner seats in Union County - Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/four-candidates-three-commissioner-seats-035900885.html,"Oct. 28—The commissioner race in Union County has four people on the ballot in the general election on Nov. 7.

Incumbent Commissioners Jeff Reber and Preston Boop will be on the Republican ticket and incumbent Commissioner Stacy Richards and newcomer Sharon Koppel will be on the Democratic ticket. Three four-year seats are available.

Both Reber and Boop declined to be interviewed for this report.

""I'm running for reelection because I feel there's still good work to be done,"" said Richards, who was elected in 2019 for her first term. ""I feel like I've been effective in the role that I've had as county commissioner. I'm well prepared with my background, education and experience to be able to continue to serve well as a Union County commissioner and serve the entire community.""

Richards is a Bucknell University graduate of 1978 and earned her masters in public administration from Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 1986. She spent her professional life in policy and government, having spent time in Washington, D.C., Boston, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. She served as deputy secretary for Pollution Prevention and Compliance Assistance under Gov. Tom Ridge. She started and managed for 14 years the energy resource center at the SEDA-Council of Governments.

Richards, a newly elected official when the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020, said the county had to learn quickly who was in need, how to run elections safely and navigate work shortages and other existing issues exacerbated by COVID. The crisis resulted in the commissioners' ability to not only invest in communities but to address long-standing issues with different groups that they may not have otherwise been able to address, she said.

""We also invested in broadband and will continue to do that to make sure the underserved in the western end of the county can join the economy and communicate more fully,"" said Richards. ""The selling of Great Stream Commons — which was set up by the previous board of commissioners and we benefitted, to be able to retire the taxpayers' debt against that loan we took out to acquire that property years ago — was a very good achievement.""

Richards said she has spent a lot of time educating the public about agricultural land being used for large-scale solar arrays. A Utility Scale Task Force was formed to help spread awareness about economic effects, she said.

Richards said her top priorities are developing public transportation, affordable housing, affordable child care and access to broadband internet. Many of these issues, especially child care, have been ignored for years, she said.

Additionally, the county needs to invest in additional technology for emergency services and internal systems to improve services for all communities. Richards also wants to promote a sense of community.

""We try to not focus on our differences,"" said Richards. ""We all love working here. We all prosper. We need to retain the beauty of our surroundings. It's good economically and it's good for our souls.""

Koppel, of Mifflinburg, won in the primary election with nearly 900 write-in votes to secure the Democratic nomination. However, Koppel said she has not been campaigning and encourages any Democratic voters to select Richards in the general election.

""It's so critically important to have the best and brightest in the position, and that's Stacy,"" said Koppel. ""I really think Stacy is the best person for the position. She has done an absolutely phenomenal job for Union County. Any Democrat you talk to in Union County echoes the same sentiment. We have an outstanding person with Stacy.""

Koppel said the county Democratic Party Committee in the Spring learned of another person who would be trying to run a write-in campaign. It was the general consensus that someone else needed to be on the ballot, she said.

""I decided to throw my name in and I won; I'm on the ballots,"" said Koppel. ""However, in Union County, there are twice as many Republicans than there are Democrats. In all my voting history, there have always been two Republicans and one Democrat on the board of commissioners. It's mathematically impossible for there to be two Democratic commissioners. I ran to get Stacy elected. I am not actively campaigning and I've been putting out signs for Stacy.""

If Koppel wins, she said she would be ""perfectly happy to serve.""

Reber, the commissioner chair, was first elected in 2019 and is seeking a second term. Boop is running for a sixth four-year term, having held the role since 2003.","iced the cake,"" said Koppel.Four candidates are seeking election to three Union County Commissioner seats in the November 7 general election: incumbents Jeff Reber and Preston Boop (R) and incumbent Stacy Richards and newcomer Sharon Koppel (D). Richards, a Bucknell and Harvard Kennedy School of Government graduate, has prioritized public transportation, affordable housing, affordable child care, and access to broadband internet during her first term, while Koppel is encouraging Democratic voters to select Richards."

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy)

CARMEL, Ind. (AP) — An Indiana Moms for Liberty chapter has followed the conservative group’s national playbook, challenging diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in school districts as part of its “parental rights” mission. But the chapter’s aims and use of a quote from Adolf Hitler in its inaugural newsletter unexpectedly spilled over this fall into a mayor’s race previously defined by local development.

The polarizing nature of Moms for Liberty, which has gained name recognition for its push to pack school boards with its endorsements, has spurred some left-leaning candidates to capitalize on opposition to the group and stir voters against their conservative opponents.

In Carmel, Indiana, the Democratic candidate for mayor has repeatedly used the group when attacking his opponent, even though the mayor's office has no administrative power over school districts, and the local chapter has publicly remained silent on the race outside of its traditional battleground.

Democratic candidate and Carmel city councilman Miles Nelson asked his opponent on stage earlier this month to denounce the local Moms for Liberty chapter.

Fellow city councilwoman and Republican Sue Finkam did not respond and later accused Nelson of trying to use national politics to inflame the race to lead the city of nearly 102,000 people located about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) north of downtown Indianapolis.

The Hamilton County chapter of Moms for Liberty told The Associated Press it can only endorse candidates for school board, but also accused Nelson of campaigning on “silencing parents.”

Florida-based nonprofit Moms for Liberty has challenged curriculum and books featuring instruction on systemic racism and LGBTQ+ topics in K-12 education. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate and extremism around the U.S., classified Moms for Liberty as an “anti-government extremist group” earlier this year.

Since its inception in 2021 amid opposition to schools' COVID-19 mandates, the organization has swiftly gained sway within Republican politics. Five GOP candidates spoke at the Moms for Liberty annual summit in Philadelphia this summer.

Wealthy, suburban Hamilton County fits the model of areas where Moms for Liberty has sought to influence school policies, according to a report by the Brookings Institution. The city of Carmel itself went for Joe Biden in 2020 after backing Donald Trump in 2016. Trump held on to the broader county in 2020, though by a narrower margin compared to 2016, according to an Indianapolis Star analysis.

The local chapter is relatively new, but its June newsletter attracted wide condemnation after quoting Hitler on its front cover. The chapter apologized shortly after and edited the newsletter.

Nelson, who described himself as a “man of devout Jewish faith” spoke out against the group on social media at the time. As a candidate for mayor, he called on Finkam to do the same.

During the Oct. 2 debate, Nelson directly asked Finkam to “denounce Moms for Liberty once and for all.”

Finkam did not reply. Her silence was met by cries from the crowd.

Finkam later said on social media that she was followed, filmed and called a “Nazi” and a “racist” after the debate. She insisted she would not “bend to my opponent’s theatrics.""

Kory Wood, senior adviser for Finkam’s campaign, said in a written statement that she has denounced the use of the quote multiple times. Finkam condemned its use in June while speaking at the Carmel Pride event, according to reporting by the Indianapolis Star.

“Her opponent is unqualified to lead our city, and is repeatedly asking about Moms for Liberty to take voters’ focus off his incompetence,” Wood said. “Sue respects our resident’s ability to elect a school board to lead school operations and curriculum.”

Paige Miller, chair of the Moms for Liberty Hamilton County Chapter, said in a written statement that Nelson has made opposing the group ""a platform for his campaign.”

“The oath of office for Mayor requires the elected official to promise to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America,” Miller wrote. “We expect our elected leaders to uphold this integral part of office which guarantees citizens freedom of speech and the right to assemble, as stated in the Constitution.”

Nelson said his continued opposition of Moms for Liberty is about supporting teachers and the school district. The mayor's office doesn't oversee schools, but local education is essential to drawing business and new residents to growing Hamilton County, Nelson said.

“What stuck was this Moms for Liberty thing,” Nelson said about the debate. “Because she was silent and it’s a hate group.”

Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, said while Moms for Liberty has rallied a base to its cause, the group also has generated staunch opposition. Affiliation with Moms for Liberty can hurt some candidates, as in the Carmel race.

“It’s a clear example of how opposition to Moms for Liberty can galvanize people to vote against conservative candidates,” Valant said.

On the other hand, Valant said, a politician distancing themselves from the group may alienate its local membership and supporters, even if the candidate is not running for school board.

Diane Shaw, 38, said her family moved to Carmel from a Chicago suburb in 2021. She and her husband have two children, 9 and 6 years old, and were drawn to the school district and lower cost of living in the area.

Shaw, a former teacher, said she is concerned about the Moms for Liberty chapter's influence in the county.

Her husband David Shaw, 41, said he considers Finkam’s silence as “alluding to support” for the group he feels drives divisive, hateful rhetoric.

“That, to me, just makes it a nonstarter,” David Shaw said. “I’ll never not vote and so it just means that Nelson is my candidate of choice.”"," ut things outside the purview of the mayor’s office,” Wood said.In the mayoral race of Carmel, Indiana, the Democratic candidate Miles Nelson has repeatedly used the conservative group Moms for Liberty to attack his opponent Sue Finkam, even though the mayor's office has no power over school districts.

""When you’re a drug addict, it’s all math. I wasn’t doing it to feel high or to feel good. I certainly wasn’t a partyer; I just wanted to sit on my couch, take five Vicodin, and watch a movie. That was heaven for me. It no longer is.""

In his memoir, he also revealed that he had 14 surgeries on his stomach after he was told he had a ""2% chance to live"".

""The doctors told my family that I had a two percent chance to live,"" he told People at the time. ""I was put on a thing called an ECMO machine, which does all the breathing for your heart and your lungs. And that's called a Hail Mary. No one survives that.""

But one of the most striking things the actor said during his book tour, was that he would like to be remembered “as a guy who lived life, loved well, lived well, and helped people. That running into me was a good thing and not something bad.”

Rest in peace, Matthew Perry.","Matthew Perry, actor of the popular sitcom ""Friends"", passed away five days after posting his final message on social media, which contained an eerie caption.

PASADENA, Calif. – Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders got battered, slammed and chased so often here Saturday night that his father Deion struggled to come up with a way to stop it.

But what could either of them do?

Colorado’s overmatched offensive line kept collapsing, making Shedeur Sanders a sitting duck for UCLA’s vaunted defense. The No. 24 Bruins (6-2) sacked him five times in the first half, leading him to get painkiller injection at halftime before the Buffaloes finally succumbed in a 28-16 loss at the Rose Bowl.

“The big picture, you go get new linemen,” Colorado coach Deion Sanders said afterward. ""That’s the picture, and I’m gonna paint if perfectly.""

Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, left, fumbles the ball as UCLA defensive lineman Gabriel Murphy, right, tackles him during the second half.

After capturing the nation’s attention with a 3-0 start, Colorado is now 4-4 with no relief in sight with four games left in the regular season. The Buffaloes next host No. 12 Oregon State Saturday at home, hoping they can find ways to survive on offense with an offensive line that struggled mightily before Saturday and then suffered some injury setbacks to make it even worse.

“I’m a little biased because I’m his father, but I think we have the best quarterback in the country,” Deion Sanders said. “I don’t think any other quarterback can put up with, stand and deliver like ours do, week in and week out and take in the beating that he’s taken. We've got to address that.”

What else did Deion Sanders say?

The Buffs’ first-year coach said his team got its “butts kicked” but also “played their butts off.” He noted how the only game his team didn’t have a chance to win this season was its 42-6 loss at Oregon last month.

Even in this game, despite his woeful offensive line, Colorado was competitive and capable of winning for most of it but didn’t score its first touchdown until there was 2:37 left in front of a sellout crowd of 71,343.

Deion Sanders even said he was proud of his team.

“They hung in there as long as they could,” Deion Sanders said.

The biggest issue was the lack of protection for his quarterback, who entered the game ranked second nationally in passing yards per game with (345.7) despite all that. On Saturday, Shedeur Sanders was sacked seven times and finished with 27-for-43 passing for 217 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions.

“Yeah, I’m cool, a little banged up right now,” Shedeur Sanders said of his health. “That's just what happens after games when you’re playing against tough opponents, a great defensive rush. That’s just what happens.”

His father said he will give him a few days off to recover.

“He’s hurting everywhere,” Deion Sanders said. “Trust me.”

The Pro Football Hall of Famer otherwise was in a somewhat jovial mood, even extending his news conference afterward by volunteering to take additional questions. One reason for this is that he has hope. He said he thinks his team is “seven to 10 players away from really doing what we want to do in college football.""

“I’m accustomed to winning, and we will win,"" Sanders said. ""We will win. Just put your seatbelt on and hold on. We will win. You’ve got to see what could possibly happen with the team that we have. I mean, we really only got our butts kicked once, and that was in Oregon … All the other games, you could see how we could have won those games. We could have done that. That’s called hope in our book.”

What happened in the game?

The Buffaloes scored field goals on each of their first two possessions of the game before punting on their next five drives as the pocket kept collapsing around quarterback Shedeur Sanders before halftime, when UCLA led 7-6.

But the Colorado defense still held the fort after being challenged by Deion Sanders in the wake of its own collapse in its previous game against Stanford. The Buffs came up with four turnovers in the first half, including two interceptions from two-way star Travis Hunter.

The problem for the Buffs is that they barely took advantage of those takeaways and only netted three points in direct result.

Making matters worse for Colorado, starting safety Shilo Sanders was ejected from the game late in the second quarter after getting penalized for targeting on a hard hit with his helmet. Deion Sanders told ABC television at halftime that he thought the penalty call against his son was “horrendous,” but replays showed Shilo Sanders’ helmet violently popping the chin of UCLA running back Carsen Ryan to stop him in his tracks.

Afterward, Deion Sanders said he was still questioning the call and said it was a “tremendous blow” to lose the “quarterback of the defense.” Shilo Sanders finished with four solo tackles and a forced fumble.

""I believe he was not in fault, because he turned his shoulder,"" Deion Sanders said. ""He always does. He knows how to hit. And I told him I’m proud of him. He was having a heck of a game.""

What did Deion Sanders tell his team at halftime?

He wasn’t happy after starting well and then caving with only 13 total yards in the second quarter. The Buffs also managed just nine rushing yards in the first half.

“I don’t recall everything I said, but it was rough,” he said of his halftime message.

It got even worse for the Buffs after halftime when UCLA needed just two plays to go 75 yards and take a 14-6 lead just 35 seconds into the second half. The Bruins caught the Buffs’ defense off guard on the second play, using a quick snap from quarterback Ethan Garbers, who found tight end Moliki Matavao open over the middle for a 26-yard touchdown pass.

UCLA then put the game away with two rushing touchdowns on back-to-back drives in the fourth quarter to take a 28-9 lead with 6:34 left. On the first of those drives, UCLA also benefited from a call that Deion Sanders questioned afterward. It happened on third down and 7 from the UCLA 49-yard line, when Garbers threw the ball to receiver Logan Loya. The play was ruled an incomplete pass before it was reversed after a replay review that showed Loya's trailing toe in bounds to keep the drive alive.

If not for that, the Buffs would have been ""off the field"" on defense, Sanders said.

That and the disqualification of Shilo Sanders had a ""tremendous bearing on the outcome of the game,"" Sanders said.

Garbers, a transfer from Washington, completed 20 of his 27 passes for 269 yards and two touchdowns with one interception.

Chip Kelly praises Shedeur Sanders

Afterward, even UCLA coach Chip Kelly said he wanted to “to give credit to Shedeur.” The Colorado junior entered the game ranked No. 8 nationally in completion percentage (72.3) even though only two teams in the nation had given up more quarterback sacks than the Buffs before Saturday with 35.

“He’s a tough kid,” he said. “I mean, he got hit and he kept balling, so it was a good battle. We are glad, we are fortunate that we came out on top.”

Shedeur Sanders didn't want to point fingers at his blockers afterward when he could have. He said his team's defense ""did everything they were supposed to do"" and that it was the offense's job to score more points.

""That's on us; that's on me,"" he said. ""We can’t afford to not put up points like that, especially when the defense is doing their job.""

His father hopes better offensive line recruits are watching and will want to come block for Shedeur next year when he'll be a senior.

""It’s very easy to understand this is what we need and this is the type of quarterback we have,"" Deion Sanders said. ""So I’m happy with what I see for the future.""

USC’s final play of the second quarter against Cal came after halftime.

Yes, that sentence is correct. Let’s explain.

Trailing 28-17, USC was attempting to get into position for a half-ending field goal as Caleb Williams hit Lake McRee for a 29-yard game while time seemingly expired. Lincoln Riley argued his case to officials that there was a second left on the clock, but both teams headed to their locker rooms and the Cal band took the field.

Wow. This game is hilarious. After this halftime discussion with Lincoln Riley/Justin Wilcox, refs rule that USC had one second left on the clock prior to time expiring in the first half.

As officials conferred, halftime continued. And then they decided that there was, in fact, one second on the clock. The officiating crew also decided to run the last play of the second quarter before the start of the third quarter instead of clearing the band off the field and bringing the teams out of the locker rooms for one play.

Officials have determined that USC had the ball with 1 second on the clock before halftime.

The unique circumstance led to USC kicker Denis Lynch getting to proceed through his normal halftime routine and practice the exact kick he’d get to attempt after halftime was over.

However, that practice didn’t pay off. Lynch missed the kick from the right hash as he pushed it too far to the left.

The missed kick allowed Cal to maintain its 11-point lead as the Bears officially started the second half with the ball. After he missed the field goal, Lynch went straight to the 35-yard line for the opening kickoff of the second half.

Cal held a 43-29 lead early in the fourth quarter but allowed three consecutive touchdowns to fall behind 50-43. The Golden Bears still had a chance to win it late after a Fernando Mendoza touchdown pass to Jaivian Thomas with just over a minute left in the game, but the ensuing two-point conversion fell incomplete and USC escaped with a 50-49 win.","Officials ruled that USC had one second left in the first half of their game vs. Cal, allowing the Trojans to kick a field goal.

Matthew Perry shared many unflinchingly candid details about his addiction struggles — and subsequent sobriety journey — in the year leading up to his death.

On Saturday, the actor — who was best known for his role as Chandler Bing on Friends — was found dead at a Los Angeles-area home, TMZ reported, citing law enforcement sources, who also confirmed Perry's death to the Los Angeles Times. Perry was 54.

In an October 2022 interview with PEOPLE, ahead of the release of his memoir, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, Perry revealed that he almost died at 49 due to his escalating drug addiction. He said he spent two weeks in a coma fighting for his life, followed by a five-month hospital stay and a year using a colostomy bag, after his colon burst from opioid overuse.

When Perry was first admitted to the hospital, doctors told his family he had only a ""2 percent chance to live.""

""I was put on a thing called an ECMO machine, which does all the breathing for your heart and your lungs. And that's called a Hail Mary. No one survives that,"" he recalled.

Perry also recounted a terrifying time during his Friends years when he was popping 55 Vicodin pills a day and had dropped to just 128 pounds.

""I didn't know how to stop,"" he said. ""If the police came over to my house and said, 'If you drink tonight, we're going to take you to jail,' I'd start packing. I couldn't stop because the disease and the addiction is progressive. So it gets worse and worse as you grow older.""

Perry revealed that he went to rehab 15 times over the years and spent a fortune trying to get sober. He told The New York Times last year that he ""probably spent $9 million or something"" in his quest to kick his addiction.

His harrowing, near-death experience was what ultimately motivated him to finally get sober.

""And a little window opened, and I crawled through it, and I no longer want OxyContin.""

Perry quit drinking after having what he described as an encounter with God in his kitchen. ""It was this bright yellow object that became all-encompassing. I couldn't see the kitchen anymore,"" he recalled.

""It was just this light, and I felt loved and understood, and in the company of God or whatever. My dad was right next to me and we were holding hands and I was praying when it started, which is something I rarely did. It was like God showed me what's possible. And then said, 'Okay. Now you go learn this.' ""

The actor said he decided to share his deeply personal experiences in his memoir in order to help others on a similar journey.

""I wanted to share when I was safe from going into the dark side of everything again,"" he said. ""I had to wait until I was pretty safely sober — and away from the active disease of alcoholism and addiction — to write it all down. And the main thing was, I was pretty certain that it would help people.""



Perry was proud of his hard-won sobriety, but never took it for granted. He told PEOPLE last year that he still counted each day.

""It's important, but if you lose your sobriety, it doesn't mean you lose all that time and education,"" he noted. ""Your sober date changes, but that's all that changes. You know everything you knew before, as long as you were able to fight your way back without dying, you learn a lot.""

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Nikki Haley swipes at Trump as GOP candidates tout staunch ... - Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-swipes-trump-gop-235316811.html,"LAS VEGAS — Republican presidential candidates delivered speeches touting their staunch support for Israel at the annual Republican Jewish Coalition’s summit Saturday — and sought to peel support away from former President Donald Trump, the front-runner, who recently faced backlash for criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and calling Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, “very smart.”

“America needs a captain who will steady the ship, not capsize it, and Republicans need a candidate who can actually win,” former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in her remarks, pointedly criticizing Trump, who has drawn strong support from Orthodox Jews, according to a poll this year by the Jewish Electoral Institute.

“I will not criticize Israel’s prime minister in the middle of a tragedy and war,” Haley added as Israel expanded its ground offensive in Gaza, with Netanyahu warning of a long and difficult war after Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7. More than 7,000 people, including women and children, have died in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. In Israel, about 1,400 people have died.

At the gathering of Jewish conservatives in Las Vegas, Vivek Ramaswamy expressed support for Israel’s right to dismiss the “myth” of a two-state solution, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis referred to the West Bank as “the most ancient Jewish land going back to biblical times,” and Sen. Tim Scott of Florida reiterated his calls to deport foreign students participating in “antisemitic” protests on college campuses.

The efforts by Haley and her fellow 2024 contenders were overshadowed in the room by former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, who unexpectedly announced that he is suspending his campaign.

“The Bible tells us that there’s a time for every purpose under heaven. Traveling across the country over the past six months, I came here to say it’s become clear to me: This is not my time,” Pence said. “So after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today.”

Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition, told reporters Pence didn’t provide any notice that he was planning to suspend his campaign at the summit.

“I had spent about 10 or 15 minutes with him in the green room beforehand, and it was never mentioned,” Brooks said. “He picked an incredibly appropriate audience to do this.”

Pence’s unexpected announcement got mixed reviews from attendees of the summit. Despite his longshot odds of reaching the White House, some of Pence’s core supporters were disheartened by the news.

“I’m depressed,” said Harry DeMell, of New York. “He’s the person with the most integrity. When the gun was to his head, quite literally, Mike Pence did the right thing for the Constitution, for America.”

Other attendees weren’t as sentimental.

“I think it’s a good thing,” Las Vegas resident Yhali Lipp said. “He wasn’t going to win anyway, and I feel like he should put his energy toward helping Trump.”

Trump didn’t refer to Pence’s dropping out in his remarks. But his speech, the longest of all the candidates, did showcase the strength of his support in the room, which was on full display even before he hit the stage.

When former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a regular critic of the former president, began speaking, several people booed, and even more left the room.

“I don’t want to hear him speak,” said Rhona Levine, of Boca Raton, Florida. “I didn’t come to hear Chris Christie.”

Scott’s speech earned him rave reviews and three standing ovations from attendees who described his remarks as “fiery,” particularly as he was touting his proposal to revoke the visas of any foreign national attending protests deemed anti-Israel at colleges and universities.

“A visa so foreign students can study here is not a right; it’s a privilege. Do you want to know what a right is? The right of Jewish Americans to walk down the street in safety,” Scott said to rapturous applause.

But it’s unclear whether Scott’s positive reception will translate into electoral support.

“His energy was just incredible. I was not expecting it, because I didn’t know much of him prior,” said Sam Mirejovsky, a resident of Las Vegas. Despite the praise, Mirejovsky still called Trump his “top contender.”

Haley, Ramaswamy and DeSantis also had some supporters in the room, but one attendee characterized their White House bids as nonviable.

“I think that we need to all be realistic here. And it’s clear that the nominee is going to be Trump,” said Milton Zerman, of Berkeley, California. “I think that having a conversation about, you know, Pence versus Haley versus [North Dakota Gov. Doug] Burgum — there’s no point, because Trump’s going to be the nominee. The polls are clear.”

Sanders, the son of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders, delivered a huge hit after a reception by UCLA’s Carsen Ryan late in the second quarter. Sanders appeared to try to lead with his shoulder, but the crown of his helmet hit Ryan in the lower part of his facemask.

As a result of the hit, Sanders was hit with a 15-yard penalty for targeting. The play was reviewed and quickly upheld, resulting in Sanders’ disqualification for the remainder of the game. Because the targeting penalty occurred in the first half, Sanders will be eligible to return for next week’s game at home vs. No. 11 Oregon State.

Sanders celebrated the hit, flexing toward the sideline. But his reaction quickly changed when he realized a flag was thrown on the play.

During his halftime interview with ABC’s Holly Rowe, Deion Sanders said he thought the targeting call was “horrendous.”

Shilo Sanders, the older brother of Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders, is one of the best players on Colorado’s defense. Earlier in the half, he forced a fumble with a big hit on UCLA running back Carson Steele. That was one of four turnovers Colorado forced in the first half. Steele had two fumbles and Buffs star cornerback Travis Hunter intercepted two passes.

Despite the forced turnovers, Colorado went into the halftime locker room trailing only 7-6. Things changed in the second half, however. UCLA's offense cleaned up the mistakes and ended up pulling away for a 28-16 victory.

UCLA improved to 6-2 overall and 3-2 in Pac-12 play with the win while Colorado fell to 4-4 (1-4 Pac-12).

The Buffs started the season 3-0, but the path to a bowl game will be a difficult one. The Buffs will host No. 11 Oregon State and Arizona in the next two weeks before closing out the year on the road versus Washington State and Utah.","Shilo Sanders was ejected for targeting during the first half of Colorado's game at UCLA on Saturday.

For the first six games of the season, it looked like North Carolina’s defense was vastly improved. But the last two weeks in losses to Virginia and Georgia Tech shows that it was all fools gold.

In the loss to Virginia last week, North Carolina allowed 436 total yards and 228 rushing yards. That trend continued in Week 9 against Georgia Tech as UNC allowed 635 yards total and 387 on the ground.

But perhaps the most shocking stat from Saturday’s game was that UNC allowed 246 rushing yards alone in the fourth quarter. That included 11.2 yards per carry as they sealed the deal with three touchdowns.

It was tough to watch as Georgia Tech got whatever they wanted on the ground and UNC couldn’t stop them. As soon as UNC extended the lead to 11 and it looked like it gave them some breathing room, the Yellow Jackets rolled off a 70-yard touchdown run just a few plays later.

As for the defense being gassed, they weren’t on the field much in the third quarter but after playing a lot against the Cavaliers last week, the toll is starting to set for this unit.

Following the game, Mack Brown noted that he thought the defense was beyond this.

“It’s one of those, I didn’t know what to say,” Browns said. “And I’ve been doing this 35 years … I thought we were beyond that on defense.”

But in reality, they weren’t beyond this. And it leads us to believe that it was fools gold this whole time.

It was also the kind of performance on a national stage that could break Kelly out of his status as one of the more underrated players in baseball.

Even before Saturday, Kelly was quite a story. After finishing his college career at Arizona State, he was selected in the eighth round of the 2010 MLB Draft by the Tampa Bay Rays, he played in Korea for three years after fizzling out in the Rays’ farm system, and he made his MLB debut at the age of 30. He had a 4.44 ERA two years ago but is 10th in MLB in innings pitched the past two regular seasons, with a 3.33 ERA and 1.164 WHIP.

Kelly brought his best stuff Saturday against the Rangers and lowered his postseason ERA to 2.25 in the process.

He kept the Rangers off-balance with a six-pitch mix, not throwing a single offering more than 25 times. He threw his best pitch, his changeup, 22 times and got 17 swings on it, with an average exit velocity of 79.1 mph. The Rangers put his four-seamer in play once in 25 pitches, with nine called strikes, four fouls and two whiffs.

Key moment:

With Kelly cruising, the Diamondbacks offense had its own challenge against Rangers starter Jordan Montgomery, the big left-hander who entered the game with a 1.99 career ERA in seven postseason appearances.

ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) — Kristian Vera stood on an Acapulco beach Saturday looking out toward dozens of sunken boats, including three of her own, all marked by floating buoys or just poking out of the water.

Despite losing her livelihood in Hurricane Otis’ brutal pass through Mexico’s southern Pacific coast, the 44-year-old fisher felt fortunate. That morning, she had watched a body pulled from the water and had seen the families coming and going, looking for their loved ones.

Mexican authorities raised Otis’ official toll to 39 dead and 10 missing Saturday. But Vera and others suggested that number will likely grow, in part because of the number of people who rode out on boats during what had started as a tropical storm and ended as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane on Wednesday.

Vera took turns with four others swimming out with empty gas jugs for flotation to try to raise their sunken boats from the shallow harbor.

Leaning against a small wooden fishing boat like her own, tipped on its side on a beach strewn with trash and fallen trees, Vera explained that some of the people who died were either fishers caring for their boats or yacht captains who were told by their owners that they needed to make sure their boats were OK when Otis was still a tropical storm.

“That night I was so worried because I live off of this, it’s how I feed my kids,” Vera said. “But when I began to feel how strong the wind was, I said, ‘Tomorrow I won’t have a boat, but God willing Acapulco will see another day.’”

Earlier Saturday, Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said in a recorded video message with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador posted to the platform X that the probable cause of death for the 39 was “suffocation by submersion.” She said the victims had not yet been identified and that investigations continue.

The new death toll was an increase of 12 over the initial tally of 27 announced Thursday. But the storm’s human toll was becoming a point of contention as local media reported the recovery of more bodies and López Obrador criticized opponents for trying to make it a political issue.

Rodríguez also said the number of missing rose to 10. Hundreds of families have been awaiting word from loved ones.

In Acapulco, government workers and volunteers cleared streets, gas station lines wrapped around the block for what fuel was to be had, and some lucky families found food essentials as a more organized relief operation took shape four days after the storm hit.

Military personnel and volunteers worked along Acapulco’s main tourist strip. They sliced through fallen palm trees and metal signs. Cellphone signals were partially recovered near some of the city’s most luxurious hotels, and authorities placed a charging station for people to charge their phones.

But on the periphery of the city, neighborhoods remained in total chaos. The government presence found in the touristic center was not visible in other neighborhoods. With no signal, with no water and no food, families and the elderly trudged through foot-deep mud and flooded streets to get to large warehouses someone had found full of food, taking bags of food and liquids.

Aid has been slow to arrive. The Category 5 storm’s destruction cut off the city of nearly 1 million people for the first day; it had intensified so quickly on Tuesday that little to nothing had been staged in advance.

Authorities had the difficult task of searching for the dead and missing. Many had remained incredulous that the government’s initial death toll of 27 and four missing had not risen in the past two days. Hundreds of families awaited word from loved ones.

One military official, who did not want to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to media, said officials in his area had found at least six bodies and that his own unit had found one. It had been difficult to find bodies because they were often covered in trees and other debris, he said.

In another part of the city, Orlando Mendoza, 46, walked down a highway drenched in sweat carrying two bags of tuna, sardines, water, pasta and soup. He was bringing food to his wife and three young children.

“Even though it isn’t much, it’s something,” he said as he walked down the winding mountain highway toward the city center.

A group of volunteers from the central state of Puebla who scraped together some money to help out people in the city were handing out bags of food to families like Mendoza’s gathered on the side of the highway.

Abel Montoya, 67, had been waiting in line for gasoline with hundreds of other people for an hour and a half Saturday holding an empty jug. Soldiers were overseeing the distribution of gasoline, presumably to avoid the uncontrolled ransacking of stores that happened across the city in recent days.

“I need to be able to move to search for water and ice,” he said. “Now there’s this shortage of food and I might even have to leave Acapulco, go to (the state capital) Chilpancingo.”

Gasoline had been unavailable, not because there wasn’t any, but because there was no electricity to operate the pumps.

Most families anxiously hunted for water, with some saying they were rationing their supplies. The municipal water system was out because its pumps had no power.

Officials said the military presence would grow to 15,000 in the area and López Obrador called on his armed forces to set up checkpoints in the city to avoid robberies.

López Obrador said the national electric company had told him that service had been resumed to 55% of customers in the affected area but that more than 200,000 homes and businesses remained without power.

The federal civil defense agency had tallied 220,000 homes that were damaged by the storm, he said.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,"'Friends' star Matthew Perry dead at 54, found in hot tub at L.A. home",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/matthew-perry-dead-54-found-003709270.html,""" Friends "" star Matthew Perry was found dead Saturday in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home, law enforcement sources said. He was 54.

Authorities responded about 4 p.m. to his home, where he was discovered unresponsive. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing, did not cite a cause of death. No drugs were found at the scene, sources said, but a source told The Times prescription medications were recovered at the home and hence toxicology will be part of the investigation. A representative for Perry did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment.

Los Angeles Police Capt. Scot Williams, who leads the Robbery Homicide Division that is investigating Perry’s death, said the “cause of death may not be known for some time, but at this point foul play is not suspected.” The cause of death will be determined by the Los Angeles County coroner’s office, which on Sunday officially deferred its finding pending further testing.

“We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry,"" Warner Bros. Television Group, which produced ""Friends,"" said in a statement to The Times. ""Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family. The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.”

“We are incredibly saddened by the too soon passing of Matthew Perry,"" NBC, which aired the series for all 10 seasons, said in its own statement to The Times. ""He brought so much joy to hundreds of millions of people around the world with his pitch perfect comedic timing and wry wit. His legacy will live on through countless generations.”

Saturday evening yellow-and-black LAPD crime scene tape blocked off the entrance to Blue Sail Drive, a tony street just off the Pacific Coast Highway at the crest of a hill with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean.

Shortly after 7 p.m., as multiple helicopters whirred overhead, Perry's mother, Suzanne, and her husband, broadcaster Keith Morrison, arrived on the scene. Morrison declined to comment. An LAPD officer at the scene said he had no information and that he did not know when any would be forthcoming.

Peter, a neighbor of Perry’s on Bluesail Drive who declined to give his last name Saturday evening, said he only spoke to the actor once, for five minutes, and that he was “very pleasant” and a “nice guy.”

“It’s shocking,” Peter said as he waited for the LAPD, who had barred journalists from passing the police tape, to approve him for entry. “He’s been redoing this house forever and he seemed fine. It’s very sad.”

Leo, another neighbor who declined to give his full name, said he was home when an ambulance arrived at Perry’s house Saturday afternoon. He declined to say whether paramedics tried to revive Perry or if a body was removed from the premises.

“I was shocked,” he said. “It was very disturbing and sad after all these years.”

Perry was one of his favorite actors, Leo said, and the funniest member of the “Friends” cast.

“I encountered him once and he was very, very friendly. More so than I thought,” Leo said. “It’s definitely a tragedy, especially at such a young age,” he added. “I was very heartbroken to see what happened.”

Perry, the son of actor John Bennett Perry and Suzanne Marie Langford, onetime press secretary of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau , was born in 1969 and grew up between Canada and Los Angeles after his parents separated when Perry was 1.

He got his start as a child actor, landing guest spots on ""Charles in Charge"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and playing opposite River Phoenix in the film ""A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon"" in the 1980s and early 1990s.

But his big break came when he was cast in ""Friends"" — originally titled ""Friends Like Us"" — a sitcom about six single New Yorkers navigating adulthood that premiered on NBC in 1994.

The series soon became a juggernaut, the anchor of the network's vaunted Thursday-night ""Must-See TV"" lineup, and turned Perry and his castmates Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer into mega-stars almost overnight. At its high-water mark — for a 1996 Super Bowl episode and the 2004 series finale — the series could notch more than 50 million live viewers; by its end, cast members were earning more than $1 million an episode.

As Chandler Bing, the handsome, wisecracking roommate of LeBlanc's Joey Tribbiani and, later, love interest of Cox's fastidious Monica Geller, Perry distinguished himself in a crackling ensemble cast. With his dry delivery he created a catchphrase with a mere turn of inflection, based on banter he'd shared with childhood friends: Could he be any more Chandler?

Soon, he was attached to major stars like Julia Roberts and appearing in prominent films such as 1997 rom-com ""Fools Rush In,"" opposite Salma Hayek, and 2000 ensemble mob comedy ""The Whole Nine Yards"" with Bruce Willis.

There was a dark side to the life of one of television's most beloved funnymen, however. In his 2022 memoir, ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,"" Perry recounted his lifelong struggle with addiction to alcohol and opioids. He wrote that he had his first drink at 14, but didn't recognize the signs of alcoholism until 21. Since then, he estimated, he'd spent more than $7 million on efforts to get sober, including multiple stints in rehab. His substance abuse also led to a number of serious health issues, including a five-month hospitalization in 2018 following a colon rupture that left him, he wrote, with a 2% chance to live through the night.

And it was fueled, he acknowledged during a ""Friends"" reunion special in 2021, by the pressure to land the joke in front of a live studio audience night after night.

“Nobody wanted to be famous more than me,” Perry told The Times in April, discussing ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing"" at the Festival of Books. “I was convinced it was the answer. I was 25, it was the second year of ‘Friends,’ and eight months into it, I realized the American dream is not making me happy, not filling the holes in my life. I couldn’t get enough attention. … Fame does not do what you think it’s going to do. It was all a trick.""

Perry was remembered on Saturday by friends and collaborators such as Selma Blair, Paget Brewster, Morgan Fairchild and Mira Sorvino as a singular comic talent and kind soul.

Perry’s “Friends” co-star Maggie Wheeler, who played his on-again, off-again girlfriend Janice on the hit show, shared a sweet tribute on Instagram.

“What a loss. The world will miss you Mathew Perry,” she wrote. “The joy you brought to so many in your too short lifetime will live on. I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared.”

He was also memorialized by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Pierre's son and one of Perry's childhood friends.

“Matthew Perry’s passing is shocking and saddening,” Trudeau wrote on X. “I’ll never forget the schoolyard games we used to play, and I know people around the world are never going to forget the joy he brought them. Thanks for all the laughs, Matthew. You were loved — and you will be missed.”

Though Perry estimated he had relapsed ""60 or 70 times"" since first getting sober in 2001, he maintained a steady presence on American television, playing key parts in backstage dramedy ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" and therapy sitcom ""Go On,"" and making a steady stream of guest appearances on acclaimed shows such as ""The West Wing"" and ""The Good Wife.""

Since his near-death experience in 2018, Perry had found solace in friends, frequent games of pickleball and, especially, writing. Though producing ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing"" had forced him to relive his darkest moments, it also connected him to ""all the sufferers out there"": ""I had a story to tell, a story that could really help people,"" he wrote. ""And helping others had become the answer for me.""

Indeed, for all his success as an actor and, more recently, as a bestselling memoirist, Perry told The Times in April that his work was not the center of what he hoped would be his legacy.

Asked how he’d like to be remembered, he said: “As a guy who lived life, loved well, lived well and helped people. That running into me was a good thing, and not something bad.”

""This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones. and all of his devoted fans.""

According to the Los Angeles Times, Perry apparently drowned in his hot tub. Authorities arrived to the actor's home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood at 4 p.m., the Times reported, where he was discovered unresponsive. Foul play is not suspected. The investigation is ongoing, and no cause of death has been released.

Yahoo has reached out to representatives for Perry but there was no immediate comment.

Following his time on Friends, he returned to TV again for starring roles in short-lived comedies like Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, Mr. Sunshine, Go On and a reboot of The Odd Couple opposite Thomas Lennon. In 2021, he joined with his Friends co-stars in May 2021 for a reunion special on HBO Max.

On the big screen, Perry starred in films like The Whole Nine Yards, 17 Again and Fools Rush In.

Last year, Perry released a memoir titled Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing. In the book, the actor chronicled his struggles with substance use, as well as detailed his complicated relationship with the spotlight.

Following the release of the memoir, he spoke about some of his private health struggles for the first time, including a 2018 incident in which his colon burst from opioid use.

""The doctors told my family that I had a 2% chance to live,"" Perry told People. ""I was put on a thing called an ECMO machine, which does all the breathing for your heart and your lungs. And that's called a Hail Mary. No one survives that.""

In an interview with the Washington Post in November 2022, Perry said of his memoir, “It's putting me on the map and people are talking about me again. That's nice because it’s been five or six years when there was none of that. Sometimes I think I went through the addiction, alcoholism and fame all to be doing what I'm doing right now, which is helping people.""

As word of Perry's death spread, friends and colleagues paid tribute on social media, among them Maggie Wheeler, who played Chandler's on-off girlfriend Janice; Paget Brewster, who also appeared in Friends; Odd Couple co-star Yvette Nicole Brown; and Meredith Salenger, who starred with Perry in A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon, one of his pre-Friends roles.

Matthew Perry Struggled With Substance Abuse

Instagram | Matthew Perry

In an interview with the New York Times in 2022, the ""Fools Rush In"" actor discussed his long battle with substance abuse. He revealed that his addiction began in his younger years with alcohol before advancing to more complex substances such as Vicodin, OxyContin, and Xanax.

To feed his addiction, the actor admitted to seeing eight doctors simultaneously to obtain numerous prescriptions for the same drugs. Perry also shared that he ""probably spent $9m or something trying to get sober.""

However, Perry's years of substance abuse came to a head in 2018 when he was hospitalized with pneumonia, an exploded colon, and other serious health issues. After spending two weeks in a coma and nine months with a colostomy bag, he underwent over a dozen stomach surgeries.

Perry wrote his memoir as part of his recovery and said the emotions came ""pouring out of me – the painful stuff, hospitals, rehabs, all of this stuff — it poured out of me. It went quickly.""

Perry noted that the confrontation with the actress was ""scary"" but did not explain why he felt that way.

After the confrontation, Aniston continued to reach out to Perry amid his addiction struggle, and according to Perry, this made him indebted to her.

The actor told Sawyer in a clip, per Daily Mail, ""She was the one that reached out the most. You know, I'm really grateful to her for that.""

Born in Williamstown, Massachusetts on August 19, 1969, Perry was raised in Ottawa, Canada. His mother, Suzanne Morrison, was a journalist and press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. (His stepfather is “Dateline’s” Keith Morrison.) Perry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to pursue an acting career. He made his television debut in 1979 on an episode of “240-Robert” and in the 1980s had guest spots on shows including “Not Necessarily the News,” “Charles in Charge,” “Silver Spoons,” “Just the Ten of Us” and “Highway to Heaven.” Regular roles on the series “Boys Will Be Boys,” “Growing Pains” and “Sydney” followed.

More guest spots followed on shows like “Who’s the Boss?”, “Beverly Hills, 90210,” “Dream On” and “Caroline in the City.” Perry’s big break came when he was cast as the wisecracking commitment-phobe Chandler on “Friends” as part of a tight-knit and mega-talented group of performers that included Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston , Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer . He earned an Emmy nomination in 2002 on a show that went on for 10 highly-rated seasons and was television’s hottest comedy throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s. The sextet ultimately earned $1 million per episode apiece in 2002.

Despite all of his success – or perhaps because of it – Perry was beset by alcohol and pill addiction issues as “Friends” was making him enormously famous and fabulously wealthy. He sought treatment multiple times, including in 1997 and 2001. He spoke about it in detail (along with his rise to fame) last year in his New York Times Bestselling memoir, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.” It was released nearly a year to the day before his death: November 1, 2022.

The book detailed the shocking toll that substance abuse had taken on Perry. After taking his first drink at 14, by 18 he was drinking alcohol daily. After Season Two of “Friends,” he traveled to Las Vegas to film “When Fools Rush In.” There, he had a jet ski accident that led to him being prescribed Vicodin, which was the start of his addiction to pills.

At one point, as Perry revealed in his book, he was taking 55 Vicodin pills a day, and concocted various ploys in order to get them. He’d fake migraines or other pain, and sit through MRIs with different doctors. On Sundays, he’d go to open houses and search the medicine cabinets of different homes for any pills he could find. In 2018, his colon exploded and he was in a coma for two weeks, while his family was told he had a 2% chance to live. He was put on an ECMO machine, along with four others in the hospital; the other four didn’t survive. He then lived with a colostomy bag for nine months.

Through the years, Perry wrote that he’d attended 6,000 AA meetings, went to rehab 15 times, been in detox 65 times, had been on life support and spent between $7 million and $9 million struggling to get sober. He’d had 14 surgeries — his last in January 2022, which left him with a six-inch incision and metal staples. During COVID, he was at a rehab center in Switzerland and faked pain to get 1,800 milligrams of OxyContin a day and was having daily ketamine infusions. He then had to endure surgery while there and was given a shot of propofol. He woke up 11 hours later in a different hospital and was told that the propofol had stopped his heart for five minutes. The long CPR process also broke eight of his ribs and the doctor refused to give him more meds.

Perry told Diane Sawyer in an ABC interview in 2022 after his memoir was published, “Your disease is outside doing one-armed push-ups just waiting and waiting, waiting to get you alone, because alone you lose to the disease. And now I finally feel OK and I feel like I’ve got some strength. I’ve developed some safety nets around this.”

However, it isn’t much of a stretch to imagine that all of his abuse had sufficiently weakened Perry’s heart so that it might give out in spite of his relative youth.

After “Friends” left the air in 2004, Perry continued to work steadily. He went on to star in Aaron Sorkin’s “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” for a single season (2006-07). In 2011, he created, executive produced, wrote and starred in he short-lived comedy “Mr. Sunshine.” He also had a recurring role on “The Good Wife,” starred for three seasons on the CBS reboot of “The Odd Couple” from 2015-17, and portrayed Ted Kennedy in the limited series “The Kennedys: After Camelot.” The “Friends” cast also reunited for an HBO Max special in 2021.

But there was the feeling that Perry could never quite find his footing in the nearly two decades after “Friends” went off the air. And perhaps a big part of that surrounded the devastating drug and alcohol issues that apparently dogged him nearly to the end.

When Aric Almirola confirmed Saturday what had been rumored for weeks that he wouldn’t return to Stewart-Haas Racing in 2024, he didn’t rule out competing on a limited basis.

“I’d like to not quit cold turkey,” said Almirola, who confirmed he is done racing full-time in NASCAR after this season. “I’d love to still scratch the itch, but just don’t want to do it like I have been doing it for the last 12 years where it’s 38 weeks. I’m not complaining that it’s a grand because I’ve loved it and I signed up for it, but I think, for me, as I look toward the future and what my life looks like, I would like to find a better work-life balance than what I have currently.”

“For 40 years of my life, I’ve focused on just me. I’ve served myself and worried about what’s best for me and what’s best for my career … so as I look to the future, I want to make sure that I’m focusing on trying to help others achieve their goals.”

Almirola raced 16 years in the NASCAR Cup Series and has three wins in 458 starts. He finished top-10 in the championship one time his career—fifth in 2018.

Almirola, who announced in January of 2022 that he was going to call it a career at the end of 2022 before signing on to race for SHR this year, plans to race Late Models “like I used to do when I was a kid.”

“If there’s an opportunity to run a handful of truck races … or run some Xfinity races, I think the door is open,” Almirola says. “I want to stay involved in the industry. The industry has afforded me and my family a wonderful life and I don’t want to just walk away from it.”

Almirola’s sponsor Smithfield is also leaving SHR."," After 16 years of full-time racing, Almirola has confirmed he will retire from the NASCAR Cup Series at the end of the year. Despite his retirement, Almirola plans to stay involved in the industry by pursuing limited racing opportunities and Late Model racing."
2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Fantasy Basketball Week 2 Schedule Breakdown - Yahoo Sports,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-basketball-week-2-schedule-000000808.html,"Herro has potential to push top-50 fantasy value

Tyler Herro's scoring ability sets him up to potentially exceed his borderline top-75 per game value fantasy season from last year, now fully healthy and playing the two for the Miami Heat.

Week 2 of the NBA season is also the first full week of action. As a result, 16 teams will play four games, which is great news for fantasy managers. However, four teams play just twice, with one set to have its Week 2 conclude on Wednesday. Oh, the first-ever in-season tournament begins on Friday, November 3, with seven games on the slate. Without further ado, let's take a look ahead at Week 2 and some of its important storylines.

Week 2 Schedule Breakdown

4 Games: BKN, CHA, CHI, CLE, DAL, DEN, DET, GSW, IND, MEM, NOR, ORL, PHO, POR, TOR, UTA

3 Games: ATL, BOS, LAL, MIA, MIL, MIN, NYK, OKC, SAS, WAS

2 Games: HOU, LAC, PHI, SAC

Week 2 Storylines

- The Clippers will be done with Week 2 on Wednesday

This is brutal for fantasy managers who have Kawhi Leonard or Paul George rostered (obviously, we can say this for a few other Clippers as well). Not only will Tyronn Lue's team be done for the week on Wednesday, but that game against the Lakers is the second of a back-to-back. The good news for the Clippers from a fatigue standpoint is that they won't have to travel, as the ""road"" tilt with their city rivals is preceded by a home game against the Magic on Tuesday.

Fantasy managers in leagues that require the roster to be set before the next week begins may want to sit the Clippers' stars for this round of action. While one could talk themselves into slotting Leonard or George into their lineups due to their statuses as the Clippers' lead options, you can't do that with Russell Westbrook or Ivica Zubac, or even Mason Plumlee. Start planning for Week 2 alternatives immediately.

- Shorthanded Nets and Cavaliers among the team with four games

We're not even a full week into the season, and some teams have already been hit hard by injuries. Two of those teams are the Nets and Cavaliers, with both teams having specific areas of concern heading into four-game Week 2 slates. In the case of Brooklyn, it's the frontcourt, with Nic Claxton (ankle) and Cameron Johnson (calf) being question marks for Monday's game against the Hornets.

With the former, his absence from Friday's loss to the Mavericks did not result in a promotion for Day'Ron Sharpe. Instead, the Nets went small, with Dorian Finney-Smith moving into the starting lineup. As for Johnson, his absence meant a move into the starting lineup for Cam Thomas, who has been one of the hottest scorers in the NBA. Brooklyn plays three of its four games in Week 2 on the road, finishing with an away/home back-to-back against the Bulls (Friday) and Celtics (Saturday).

- Cavaliers have multiple guards on their injury report

While Brooklyn's injury issues have been in the frontcourt, Cleveland's have largely been on the perimeter, with Jarrett Allen being the exception. Darius Garland (hamstring) was able to play in the season-opening win over the Nets but has missed the last two games, and hamstring injuries can be tricky. Backup point guard Ty Jerome sprained his ankle during Friday's loss to the Thunder, and Donovan Mitchell landed on the injury report ahead of Saturday's game against the Pacers with a sore hamstring.

Cleveland's Week 2 schedule opens with a home/away back-to-back against the Knicks on Tuesday and Wednesday, and they'll finish with games against the Pacers (Friday) and Warriors (Sunday). Cleveland went big on the wings with Garland sidelined on Friday, with Dean Wade, Isaac Okoro, and Max Strus all starting (Strus was expected to be a starter before the season began, so no surprise there). However, Caris LeVert still played 31 minutes off the bench, so ""kicking the tires"" on him, if available, wouldn't be the worst idea. Especially if the Cavaliers remain shorthanded on the perimeter.

- Are any fringe 76ers worth holding onto, given their schedule?

Philadelphia is one of the four teams that will only play two games in Week 2, beginning with the Raptors at home on Thursday. Add to this the ongoing James Harden saga, as it's unknown when he'll be ready to play or if the 76ers will actually put him on the court when that time comes, and this isn't an easy situation for fantasy managers. De'Anthony Melton is going to have fantasy value whether he starts or comes off the bench, and Kelly Oubre was highly productive in the team's loss to the Bucks on Thursday.

But Paul Reed, who appeared to be a favorite of Nick Nurse's during the offseason given the praises heaped upon him, didn't offer much production in Milwaukee. Depending on what happens in Philadelphia's back-to-back to end Week 1 (at TOR on Saturday vs. POR on Sunday), he may be someone whom even more fantasy managers look to move on from, given the 76ers' Week 2 schedule.

- Grizzlies down two more frontcourt players heading into Week 2

With Steven Adams (knee) out for the season and Brandon Clarke (Achilles) without a timeline for return, the Grizzlies were shorthanded from the start. And things got even toward the end of Week 1, as Santi Aldama (ankle) and Luke Kennard (concussion) were also sidelined. Xavier Tillman was the known fantasy add in the aftermath of the Adams news, but things are far less predictable behind him. Ziaire Williams filling in for the suspended Ja Morant put him on the radar in deeper leagues, while the recent run of frontcourt injuries has opened things up for David Roddy, Jake LaRavia, and John Konchar. But can any of those four be relied on, even with the Grizzlies set to play four games in Week 2 without a back-to-back? Konchar may be the best of the bunch, but all three are extremely deep-league options at best.

- It's Shaedon Sharpe Time in Portland

Ahead of Friday's loss to the Magic, the Trail Blazers announced that starting guard Anfernee Simons would need surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb. He's expected to miss 4-6 weeks, with Shaedon Sharpe being the replacement in the starting lineup. The second-year wing got up 23 shots on Friday, scoring 24 points with five rebounds, two assists, two steals, and four 3-pointers in 41 minutes. The combination of usage and minutes played for Sharpe was great as far as his fantasy value is concerned, hence his being rostered in 74% of Yahoo leagues.

Even better for those who have Sharpe is that Portland plays four games in Week 2, beginning Monday in Toronto. Malcolm Brogdon, who's rostered in 68% of Yahoo leagues, will also have enhanced fantasy value, while deep-league managers should keep an eye on rookie Toumani Camara. Acquired from the Suns as part of the three-team Damian Lillard trade, the second-round pick out of Dayton appears to have locked down a spot for himself in Chauncey Billups' rotation. Camara may not be a great option right now, but he's someone who could become a household name after the trade deadline if Portland's season goes as many expect it to.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,I drank apple cider vinegar every day for 10 days - Tom's Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-drank-apple-cider-vinegar-every-day-for-10-days-like-victoria-beckham-heres-what-happened-to-my-body,"We see many celebrity trends floating around on social media, and drinking apple cider vinegar isn’t exactly new. But is there anything to the health trend? Ever the curious journalist, I decided to find out.

Victoria Beckham posted on her Instagram Stories that she takes apple cider vinegar every morning without fail, and other celebs like Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry have also reportedly taken to sipping the cider vinegar as a daily ritual. It’s considered to be a powerhouse of health benefits, from aiding weight loss and digestion to improving your skin and protecting your gut health.

I decided to drink two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar every morning for 10 days to see what (if anything) happened to my body, sometimes taking it on my morning walk using one of the best water bottles.

Before jumping in, it’s worth remembering that we don’t encourage food fads at Tom’s Guide, and we spoke to a qualified dietician while digging into the perceived health benefits and whether they ring true.

What works for my body might not work for you, so we recommend exercising caution if you plan to give it a try. The celebrity trends just keep coming, don’t they? And on that note, off I went in search of apple cider vinegar. Here’s what happened.

What are the benefits of drinking apple cider vinegar?

Drinking apple cider vinegar (ACV) has long been associated with being antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, aiding weight loss, curbing appetite and improving insulin sensitivity, helping to control blood sugar and diabetes.

ACV has also been touted for protecting gut health, lowering cholesterol levels and reducing muscle cramps during or after workouts, even increasing energy levels in some people.

However, the research is mixed and limited. The Mayo Clinic says, “Proponents of apple cider vinegar claim that it has numerous health benefits and that drinking a small amount or taking a supplement before meals helps curb appetite and burn fat…there's little scientific support for these claims.” The existing studies into apple cider vinegar for weight loss haven’t been significant or consistent, and it could carry risks.

We spoke to elite sports dietician Nigel Mitchell, who tells us that apple cider vinegar is the result of a two-stage fermentation to produce alcohol (cider) and acetic acid (vinegar). Apple cider is highly acidic, and the Mayo Clinic claims it could irritate your throat “if you drink it often or in large amounts.” It could also interact with diuretics and insulin and other drugs.

Yikes. So, do any studies support drinking apple cider vinegar? Here’s what I learned.

I drank apple cider vinegar every day for 10 days — here's what happened

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

According to my research, most studies recommend starting small with no more than two tablespoons of ACV a day, diluted to protect your tooth enamel and oesophagus from its acidity (not worrying at all), so I mixed mine with a large glass of hot water and got drinking.

My mouth felt clean

I know, weird one, right? But there’s something to it. When digging into the best time to drink apple cider vinegar, many prefer the morning before you’ve eaten anything. Reportedly, it freshens the breath and boosts the digestive system.

One clinical trial study found that the antimicrobial properties of ACV could kill bacteria in the mouth and reduce plaque build-up. And some research suggests that ACV contains traces of pectin (a soluble fiber that apples are rich in). Pectin reportedly acts as a gentle laxative, but there’s a lack of evidence to back up the effectiveness of ACV in this arena.

I got used to the taste

Granted, it doesn’t beat a strong cup of coffee in the taste department, but I began looking forward to my morning ritual. If you don’t enjoy the taste — boy, is it strong — squeezing some fresh lemon juice into your cup or adding ACV to herbal tea can make it more enjoyable. Our writer drank lemon water every day for 2 weeks — here’s what happened and the health benefits.

I felt just as hungry

Sadly, I still had my eye on my partner's home-baked apple pie sitting in the fridge at home. It didn’t look, smell, or taste any less appealing following a morning ritual of supping apple cider vinegar.

One review of short-term studies found that those who consumed ACV with a meal experienced reduced appetite for up to 120 minutes afterward and snacked less for up to 24 hours after consumption. Sadly, my stomach must have missed the memo.

It didn't help my skin

I wasn't expecting much dermatologically — my editor drank a gallon of water a day for a month and didn't see a difference either.

One perceived benefit of drinking apple cider vinegar is that it helps clear bad skin. According to the National Eczema Organization, ACV could help. The organization says, “People with eczema typically have higher pH levels than those without…the skin barrier doesn’t function as it should.”

That means the skin’s microbiota (a guard against “bad” bacteria) can break down and expose the skin to harm. As ACV “is a mild acid,” those with eczema “theorize that applying ACV topically may help restore their skin’s natural pH level.”

I didn’t notice much difference in my skin, although I usually break out in spots around this time in my menstrual cycle, which I seem to have avoided this time around — that could also be a coincidence.

My system felt energized

I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I felt better in the mornings. Equally, this could have been a placebo effect from deep diving into studies and research, but my stomach felt more settled, and I experienced less of the morning bloat.

According to Science Direct, quality brands may contain amino acids and antioxidants, and ACV could have antidiabetic effects and help lower the levels of “bad” cholesterol (LDLs) in the blood. Unfiltered apple cider vinegar contains “mother,” the cloudy bit at the bottom of the bottle — the pure, raw part that contains good bacteria and enzymes, similar to a prebiotic. ACV purists say it’s a powerhouse of antioxidants and helps promote healthy gut flora.

Even for a limited time, my system felt more settled.

I drank apple cider vinegar every day for 10 days — here’s my verdict

It wasn’t a life-changing 10 days for me. And no shock there — it’s unlikely a daily shot of apple cider vinegar could be a cure-all for anyone.

That said, some research has been interesting to read, mostly around blood sugar and muscle cramping. One 2019 clinical trial shows that ACV consumption could improve the glycaemic index and oxidative stress of people with diabetes, and another study found vinegar could lower blood sugar levels after meals and improve insulin function. A piece of research into muscle recovery found that potassium-rich ACV could improve leg cramps and aid muscle relaxation in athletes due to the acetic acid!

Sadly, I still had my eye on my partner's home-baked apple pie sitting in the fridge at home. It didn’t look, smell, or taste any less appealing following a morning ritual of supping apple cider vinegar.

I can hold up my hands and say that 10 days may not be long enough to witness miraculous change, but I didn’t report many noticeable short-term improvements. I felt slightly less bloated in the morning, and my system felt temporarily “cleaner,” but it didn’t change my appetite, mood, or digestive system or impact my muscles. I had fun experimenting with it, but I’ll stick to my morning coffee for now, I think.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Angelina Jolie Says Hamas Terrorist Attacks in Israel “Cannot ... - Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/angelina-jolie-says-hamas-terrorist-060516802.html,"Angelina Jolie has shared a statement amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

The Oscar-winning actress took to Instagram on Saturday, writing, “Like millions around the world I have spent the last weeks sick and angry at the terrorist attack in Israel, the death of so many innocent civilians, and wondering how best to help. I too am praying for the immediate, safe return of every hostage, and for the families who carry the unimaginable pain of a murder of a loved one. Above all, the children murdered, and the many children now orphaned.”

More from The Hollywood Reporter

She continued, “What happened in Israel is an act of terror. But that cannot justify the innocent lives lost in bombing a civilian population in Gaza that has nowhere to go, no access to food or water, no possibility of evacuation, and not even the basic human right to cross a border to seek refuge.”

For 20 years, Jolie worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, campaigning in support of forcibly displaced people around the world. She first joined in 2001 as a UN goodwill ambassador and then in 2012, she was made a special envoy. Last year, she stepped down from her role with the UNHCR, saying at the time that she wanted to tackle a wider set of humanitarian and human rights issues.

“My focus is on the people displaced by violence in any context,” Jolie’s statement read. “Gaza has a population of over 2 million people (half of them children), who have lived under a severe blockade for nearly two decades, on top of decades of displacement and statelessness.”

She added, “The few aid trucks that are entering are a fraction of what is needed (and was delivered daily before the present conflict), and the bombings are causing desperate new humanitarian needs daily. The denial of aid, fuel and water is collectively punishing a people. Humanity demands an immediate ceasefire. Palestinian and Israeli lives — and the lives of all people globally — matter equally.”

Since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas launched an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, leading to a death toll in the thousands, the conflict has continued to escalate. In response, Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip and retaliated with air strikes.

A week ago, the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza opened to allow just a handful of trucks carrying aid into the territory — an amount that aid workers have said was insufficient to address the unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the Associated Press reported.

Jolie concluded Saturday’s statement by noting that she continues to donate to medical relief efforts and has “chosen to support the work of Doctors Without Borders”

However, rather than matching costumes, the married couple coordinated in glamorous evening looks.

The multi-hyphenate and the filmmaker were photographed arriving at Australian model and actress Pia Miller's 40th birthday bash last night in LA. To celebrate their longtime pal, the ""Waiting for Tonight"" singer chose a luxurious satin gown made of chartreuse green fabric, which featured an asymmetrical skirt with a flouncy scalloped hem. While the top of the dress was covered, the ankle-skimming hem peaked out from under Lopez's pristine white coat, which was tied at the waist with a matching white belt.

The star finished the look with strappy heeled sandals in a matching shade of green, while carrying a structural gold clutch. Her only visible jewelry was an array of rings, including her green diamond engagement ring. As for her glam, she wore her hair in a wavy blowout, and topped off her bronzed makeup with a nude lip.

Meanwhile, the Air director looked cool in a classic black suit, a white button-down, and black dress shoes. He offered his arm to his wife, who held onto him as they walked into the venue.

Miller and her husband Patrick, who is a chairman of Endeavor Talent Agency, are longtime friends of the Afflecks and were among the star-studded guests at their lavish Georgia wedding in August 2022, which followed their secret Las Vegas ceremony a month prior. This year, Lopez marked her first wedding anniversary by posting a loving tribute to her husband on Instagram, which included two never-before-seen photos from the romantic affair. In the throwback images, the newlyweds share a laugh and kiss passionately while Lopez is dressed in her in two of her three stunning Ralph Lauren dresses.","Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck attended Pia Miller's 40th birthday bash in Los Angeles and coordinated in glamorous evening looks.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Tulsa lawmaker presses for free school lunches,https://tulsaworld.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/tulsa-lawmaker-presses-for-free-school-lunches/article_6c5294a8-74f9-11ee-8800-93e5f724ddcb.html,"OKLAHOMA CITY — A Tulsa lawmaker said he will again push to expand free school lunches.

Last session, Rep. Jeff Boatman, R-Tulsa, filed House Bill 1376. The measure on March 21 passed the House by a vote of 91-7, but it failed to get a hearing before the Senate Education Committee. The measure is still alive.

Boatman said it is difficult to put an exact price tag on the cost, but the state has plenty of money to pay for it.

“It is hungry kids,” he said. “It is not something we should be playing politics with.”

Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, said during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional federal dollars were made available to expand the program, but those dollars have now expired, which is why the state needs to step in.

Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado, Vermont, Michigan, and Massachusetts made school breakfasts and lunches permanently free to all students starting this academic year, regardless of family income. Students already get free meals through legislation in California and Maine. Several other states are considering similar changes.

The debate over vouchers last session in the Oklahoma Legislature took up a lot of oxygen, Waldron said.

Shawn Hime, Oklahoma State School Boards Association executive director, said his organization did not take a position on the bill but was focused on the largest increase in school funding in state history.

Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, chairs the Senate Education Committee. He said he does not plan to hear the bill next session.

Pugh said the state gave schools more than $500 million in additional dollars.

“So if school districts want to expand who they offer those services to, they have the resources already to do that,” Pugh said.

Pugh said he was clear with his caucus on the issue.

“We need to be careful during COVID,” he said. “When federal money was expanding programs, the money was going to go away and we would be asked to continue the programs and foot the bill. And that is what happened here.”

No district has come to him and asked him to expand the program, Pugh said.

How a student might qualify

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, school districts’ child nutrition programs in Oklahoma and the 47 other contiguous states are reimbursed anywhere from $0.38 to $4.25 per meal, depending on the meal in question and whether the children served qualify for free or reduced-price school meals.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture authorizes eligibility for free school meals if a child’s family’s income is up to 130% of the federal poverty line or for reduced-price school meals if the family’s income is up to 185% of the federal poverty line.

For a family of four, that means an annual income of no more than $55,500 for a child to be eligible for reduced price meals, or $39,000 for free meals.

House Bill 1376 would make all children in households with income at or below 250% of the federal poverty line eligible for free lunches for the next two years, Boatman said. For a family of four, that would mean an annual income of up to $75,000.

Children may also qualify through direct certification if their family receives benefits through SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations or if they are part of the foster care system. Additionally, starting this year, Oklahoma is participating in a pilot program that includes Medicaid recipients among those eligible for direct certification.

The electronic data-matching process means eligible students who receive those services do not have to fill out an additional application to receive free or reduced-price school meals.

The National School Lunch Program has a Community Eligibility Provision that allows all students at a school or a group of schools to eat for free. Tulsa Public Schools currently uses that provision for all of its elementary schools, as do a handful of districts and individual schools around northeastern Oklahoma.

Previously, in order for a school or group of schools to qualify for CEP, at least 40% of those students must be identified as eligible for free or reduced-price meals. However, the USDA announced earlier this school year that starting Thursday, the qualifying threshold is now 25%.

Determining an accurate price tag for providing free school meals for all public school students is difficult, said Hunger Free Oklahoma Executive Director Chris Bernard.

“There are so many new variables that it is hard to give an exact number right now,” Bernard said, noting the change to the Community Eligibility Provision and addition of Medicaid to the direct certification process.

District urges families to apply

Union Public Schools’ child nutrition department currently serves almost 15,000 meals per day.

Bradyn Powell, Union’s child nutrition director, said the changes have helped increase the number of students getting assistance with meals.

“Adding Medicaid in there increased our direct certification rate significantly,” she said. “That increased our (free and reduced-price meal) rate right off the bat, plus the economy in general.”

The district also worked to get administrators involved in the process, creating opportunities to help parents fill out the free and reduced-price meal application.

“We’ve really tried to make that time available for families at back-to-school nights, schedule pickups, meet the teacher nights and other events that we have as a district,” Powell said. “We’re trying to ... encourage families to fill out those applications.”

Although the district’s eligibility rate for the current year has not yet been certified, Powell said the response rate as of mid-September was on track to surpass the district’s all-time record of 72%, which was set last school year.

Waldron said Boatman’s bill, if passed, would help reduce lunch debt and lunch shaming. He pointed out some kids are made to feel inferior because their parents haven’t paid the lunch bill.

“They are sitting with a cheese sandwich when the other kid has pizza,” Waldron said. “How is he going to feel about the school reminder of inequality every day in his face at lunch — and giving the kid a note to take home. That is lunch shaming.”

Boatman said it comes down to supporting academic achievement.

“The big thing is (many students) are not eating and able to perform and learn and do well in school because they are hungry,” he said. “It became an outcomes issue for me.”"," schools in other parts of the state.Oklahoma Rep.

2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,"Allen Johnson: As homecoming approaches at A&T, something's missing",https://greensboro.com/opinion/column/allen-johnson-as-homecoming-approaches-at-a-t-somethings-missing/article_e3e8f9da-75a8-11ee-b350-f7db5cfa4990.html,"“Yes, there will be class next week,” I tell my students this time of year.

While homecoming at N.C. A&T may seem like a weeklong holiday to students and alumni, I remind them, it is not.

Class will go on … with or without them.

They typically sigh in disappointment … and then most do show up, even if some are a little bleary-eyed.

And we prove once again that that there is ample room in the universe for the Greatest Homecoming on Earth and learning how to write news stories.

I don’t exactly recall when A&T started branding its homecoming as the Greatest Homecoming on Earth, or GHOE, but it’s more substance than hype.

Rooted in deep tradition and fed by passions of the proud and devoted, it’s a week’s worth of concerts, tailgates, pageants, step shows, soul-food dinners, Greensboro’s best parade … and, oh yeah, a football game.

It’s one tradition that seems destined to endure, well, forever.

As for one of the other traditions at the nation’s largest historically Black college or university, or HBCU, I’m not so certain.

Before I go on, a disclaimer: I’m not officially an Aggie. I’m a UNC alum, so I’ll understand if you take what I’m about to say with the Biggest Grain of Salt on Earth.

But I have taught at A&T for more than two decades and, if it were not for A&T, I would not be here today. My parents met at A&T, dated there as students and married and settled in Greensboro.

So, I kinda sorta have a dog in this fight.

Anyway, on the cusp of another homecoming I’m still not feeling A&T’s quest for bigger-time football. Nor do I believe I’m alone.

Something seems different now that the Aggies have left an HBCU conference, the MEAC, to compete in the Big South and now the Coastal Athletic Association.

There’s not the same buzz of anticipation that typically accompanies a match-up with, say, MEAC rivals N.C. Central or Howard.

On paper and on the field, the CAA may be superior to the MEAC, but as I sense it, fans simply aren’t getting psyched up for epic showdowns with Monmouth or Delaware.

Maybe that will come with time. After all, this is a down season for the Aggies. But even in the midst of a winning season last year you could sense that something was missing.

Ask most fans which game on the schedule excites them the most and you’re likely to hear N.C Central — an old MEAC rival that still plays in A&T’s old league.

I understand the unbridled ambition that A&T Chancellor Harold Martin has brought to nearly every aspect of his alma mater, from academics to student life to fundraising to athletics.

But bigger isn’t always better. Sometimes even better isn’t better.

There are other examples.

When UNCG moved its home men’s basketball games from Fleming Gym on campus to the Greensboro Coliseum, you had to admire the gumption of the shift.

But was sacrificing the intimacy and the energy of a cracker box on campus for seas of empty seats in the Greensboro Coliseum really worth it?

Then there was Greensboro’s longtime minor-league hockey team, the Greensboro Monarchs, who became the Carolina Monarchs and moved to highest level of minor-league competition, the American Hockey League.

The style of hockey in the AHL was faster and cleaner, the players more talented … and the fans didn’t care. They missed the kinship they felt with the team in the old days, when they knew players and might have a beer with them in a local bar.

After two seasons in Greensboro, the team ultimately moved to New Haven, Conn., where it became the Beast of New Haven and lasted for two seasons — under a coach named Kevin McCarthy (no, not the same guy).

My point is, sometimes there’s something to be said for growing where you’ve planted roots.

This applies as well to the so-called major college conferences that are coming and going and shuffling their memberships by the minute in a mad dash for more TV dollars while casting tradition, geography and fan loyalty to the wind.

To be clear, my unease about ATo be clear, my unease about

A&T’s football ambitions don’t extend to its quest to become the lone HBCU to attain “R1,” top-tier research university status (the only other R1’s in North Carolina are Duke, N.C. State and UNC-Chapel Hill).Currently no HBCU in the country holds that credential.

It’s a high bar but the foundation is there. A&T faculty and staff obtained $147.4 million in research and program funding in the 2023 fiscal year — $50 million more than the year before. I say go for it.

You don’t have to be major league in football to be major league in academics. Just ask Harvard.

Happy homecoming.","alties to the wind.A&T is doing the same, and I’m not sure it’s necessarily for the better.I've been teaching at N.C. A&T for over two decades and while homecoming may seem like a holiday, I remind my students that class will go on. Homecoming at A&T is rooted in deep tradition and is celebrated with concerts, tailgates, pageants, step shows, and more. However, I'm not sure if A&T's ambition for bigger-time football is necessarily for the better, as the same buzz and anticipation isn't there as when they were in the MEAC. We should be wary of sacrificing tradition and fan loyalty for the sake of 'bigger is better'."
2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,Shadow boxing with the budget - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday,https://newsday.co.tt/2023/10/29/shadow-boxing-with-the-budget/,"Shadow boxing with the budget

-

The presentation and debate over the national budget – the country’s socio-economic bible – is one of Parliament’s great show.

Apart from the money, it allows citizens to judge who is who – performance. The witty, quick-learning engineer-turned Minister of Finance, Colm Imbert, took four hours with his $59 billion ($6 billion deficit) budget, followed by two tiring weeks of very serious performances by dutiful members of both houses of Parliament.

What was the impact of these speeches on the budget?

In fact, Mr Imbert’s glossy budget document left as it ceremoniously entered. Not one word or number changed as far as I gather. What was the debate about then?

Soon after Imbert spoke, Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar quickly blasted his performance as ""painfully deceptive"" and ""painfully out of touch.""

The stage was set. Briefly, in act one in the Lower House, each government minister dutifully gave a report, each time attracting unfriendly, sometimes, blistering reaction from opposition members. That’s what the system now expects.

Same thing in act two in the Upper House with the nine independents, except two, seeking moderation. But at the end of all these well-prepared speeches – mediated by patient presiding officers – what was really achieved? What changed? If nothing, then some reality check is needed about the system. Tradition must not block logic, reason.

Some brief debate references: Works and Transport Minister, the besieged Rohan Sinanan, rolled into attack by pointing to the country’s “biggest scandal” – the UNC’s fiddling with Point Fortin highway OAS contract few days before the 2015 election. (loud desk-thumping, laughter, cross-talk). The UNC told the PNM “take it to court.” And so, the “you did it too” began.

The indomitable UNC senator Anil Roberts then rebuked government for “wasting taxpayers” money from the 1960s “Lock Joint” project to the “mono-rail $481 million feasibility study.” (loud desk-thumping, cross-talk, laughter). Temporary UNC senator Dr Tim Gopeesingh criticised the health system after which Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh returned a knock-out blow by reminding Gopeesingh how many doctors saved him when he had covid. (PNM MPs’ laughter) Gopeesingh remained shell-shocked.

Feisty UNC senator Jayanti Lutchmedial criticised expenditures, missing files and lost cases by the Attorney General’s office, then alleged that we have a “lawless government.” (loud UNC desk thumping) Well, that seemed to hurt. Colourful government senator Renuka Sagramsingh-Sooklal loudly assailed Ms Lutchmedial for not supporting the Bail (Amendment) Act. (loud PNM desk thumping).

Passionate UNC senator David Nakhid went for the political jugular when he criticised the PNM for allowing their respective constituencies, especially Laventille, to remain “destitute” and “crime-ridden.” (protests from govt side, UNC desk-thumping). Will this change Imbert’s precious document?

More excitement to come. Ms Persad-Bissessar brought back former Nidco chairman Carson Charles as a UNC senator obviously to respond to repeated allegations of UNC corruption with the OAS contract. The experienced Charles explained that there were “protective provisions” for the country. Charles also tackled food production by reminding us how Tobago used to feed us and Caricom states with provisions, farm products, etc. Many heads nodded.

Seeming to put a nail in the coffin, Imbert’s winding up speech emphasised that there was still “no explanation” for the OAS allegation. These performances should encourage, government to get real and expedite the promised inquiry for which $11 million curiously already spent. Clear the air. Stop the shadow-boxing.

The reality is not so much the heated debate but that no substantial change is expected to be made to Mr Imbert’s precious documents. That’s the system.

So what was the use, really, of the two weeks’ performances?

There is some accounting but where are the sanctions? Is it just shadow-boxing or what? Are the politicians satisfied with this? No concrete suggestion for reform from either side, especially when it should include constitution and parliamentary reform. Or is it a sad reflection of the “intellectual laziness” senator Lutchmedial mentioned or the “intellectual deficiency” senator Nakhid cited?

Next year, as the years before, will be the same well-prepared performances with nothing changed. We keep using the same system we had before political independence.

Do politicians really like it so? When are we going to emancipate our political system? This national budget needs to be democratised beyond simple, rigid majority control. Sharing the country’s resources equitably has very far-reaching consequences for all constituencies – government and opposition.","mpact of the lengthy debate over the budget? The presentation and debate of the national budget allows citizens to judge performance, however, the budget document remains unchanged. This highlights the need for a reality check on the system, allowing logic and reason to supersede tradition."
2023-10-29T00:00:00.0000000,City short on lodging tax income - Uvalde Leader News,https://www.uvaldeleadernews.com/articles/city-short-on-lodging-tax-income/,"More than 20 property owners dodging efforts

City staff is asking over two dozen short term rental property owners to comply with city rules after estimating the city is losing about $80,000 per year from non-payment of the city’s 7 percent hotel occupancy tax.

City finance director Felix Castillo said Oct. 24 the city built a portal to make the process easy, but no one owning a short term rental property has signed up.

Castillo said the city legally has the option of seeking four years worth of back taxes from owners of Airbnb, Vrbo and similar listings, but it is instead offering owners a chance to come into compliance now and avoid such measures.

He said his department has been woking with city director of planning and development, Susan Anderson.

“I learned a new concept about the carrot and the stick, I didn’t know anything about that, so thank you, Susan. So what we’ve been doing is using the carrot right now. As you know, the administration decided not to go for back taxes. I mean, we can if we want to, but we decided not to do it,” Castillo said.

He said they are making every effort to ensure owners are aware of city rules, including the need for permits and to pay the HOT tax on these types of rentals. HOT tax is a pass-through expense, which means the city tax fee should also be built into the cost of the stay.

City staff refrained from releasing owner information, as they are still working on communication and outreach.

One issue is that large companies like Airbnb build the 6 percent state HOT tax into rental costs but not the city’s 7 percent tax. As cities and municipalities typically have varying tax fees, those need to be added by owners or property managers.

City staff developed door hangers with clear instructions and graphics explaining the process, which will be placed at the rental properties. Delinquency letters are also being mailed, and phone calls have been made in an effort to reach owners.

Council approved a $15,000 contract with Avenu Insights & Analytics on June 27 to identify and contact short term rentals. Owners of short term rentals may visit www.hoteltaxonline.com to create an account, submit monthly reports and make hotel occupancy tax payments.

The company initially found 29 short-term Uvalde rentals available, which is now down to about 23, as people list and remove rooms and properties for rent.

Castillo said one owner who has multiple properties is paying city HOT tax. That proprietor’s payments totals about $11,696 for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2023..

City staff estimated the loss from those not paying to be between $80,000 and $90,000 annually.

Tax payments made from multi-unit hotels are $764,362. Castillo said they pay faithfully.

Two city officials were particularly perturbed by the situation.

Councilman Hector Luevano advocated for stronger measures to get owners into compliance and for staff to pursue recovery of past taxes.

Luevano expressed dismay that some owners of short term rentals had been out of compliance for years.

“Let me give you a scenario. What if none of our local hotels were paying our city taxes? What would be our recourse?” Luevano asked.

The city has an ordinance in place stating they will collect hotel and motel occupancy tax.

“There’s things we can do for people that are not obeying our ordinances, but we were trying to use a carrot first and get them compliant,” Anderson said.

She said, ultimately, the city can take owners to court for breaking city ordinance.

“I would go one step further, I would identify the properties and if they don’t comply, cut the water and the sewer off,” said Mayor Don McLaughlin Jr. “That will get their attention.”

“Well, let’s wait on that,” rapidly said Paul Tarski, city attorney, creating a round of laughter from the room.

Councilman Ernest W. “Chip” King III said he thinks some short term area rentals are run mom-and-pop style.

“I would be reluctant to go after a mom and pop and say you owe me $15,000 for the last four years. I would say you need to make sure you’re getting in compliance,” King said.

“The HOT tax benefits them because it advertises for them, it goes for them… we can’t spend it. We can’t buy our $400,000 garbage truck with it tonight, I wish we could,” King said.

He said he would endorse stricter measures for corporations.

Castillo said staff has the tools in place to move forward, and they will be on top of the situation, trying to get owners to come into compliance.

“I was hoping that everybody was going to jump on board on Sept. 1, boom, we got all 23, but didn’t happen. So we’re going to go after them and we’ll see how successful we are in the next months,” Castillo said.

Luevano asked for regular updates on the situation to be made to council members.

Virgin Money has launched a ""fantastic"" two-year fixed rate mortgage deal for homeowners and house buyers amid the Cost of Living crisis. Newspage reports brokers have hailed the revised interest rate changes from the financial services provider - calling it: ""Fantastic.""

Virgin Money has said a 60 per cent LTV Two Year Fixed Rate will be launched at 5.09 per cent and a 70 per cent LTV Two Year Fixed Rate will be launched at 5.15 per cent. Justin Moy, the managing director at Chelmsford-based EHF Mortgages, explained: “More rate reductions can only be good news for borrowers, as market competition is the main reason why rates continue to edge downwards.

“There is a very interesting two-year fixed rate deal at 5.09 percent with a one percent fee, and this may be the quickest way we will see sub-five percent short-term deals in the coming months. The take-up numbers will be interesting. Either way, more product innovation from lenders can only be encouraged.”

Steven Hargreaves, a mortgage and protection adviser at The Mortgage Co, added: “The headline rates are very good, and yet more evidence that the fixed rate war is continuing. When advising on products you would always show a client the difference between a lower rate with high product fees and a higher rate with no product fees.

“That said to see these rates compared to what we were discussing with clients a couple of months ago is fantastic.” Charwin Private Client director, Ranald Mitchell, explained: “It’s good to see more rate reductions but it is the introduction of percentage fees rather than flat product fees that grabs attention.

“Whether these will benefit any particular case is entirely dependent on that set of circumstances, but there will be benefits to some. It seems like the offsetting of mortgage interest to fees is becoming more of a thing in the mortgage space.” Switch Mortgage Finance director, Elliott Culley, stated: “Virgin is trying something different here while taking a leaf out of Skipton’s book of a charging percentage.”

Culley added that Virgin was a lender trying to find more business while rates are a little stagnant. From a broker’s perspective, it’s good to have options for customers and everyone’s situation is slightly different.""","Virgin Money has launched competitive two-year fixed rate mortgages in response to the Cost of Living crisis.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,"Housing market headed back to a 1980s-style recession, Wells ... - Fortune",https://fortune.com/2023/10/30/housing-market-recession-1980s-higher-for-longer-mortgage-rates-outlook-wells-fargo/,"Despite countless recession calls from economists, analysts, and other experts this year and last, the U.S. economy as a whole has shown remarkable resiliency. The housing market, on the other hand, is a different story.

Mortgage rates hovering around 8% coupled with home prices that rose substantially during the pandemic have deteriorated housing affordability in the U.S. and frozen activity in some cases. The longer mortgage rates remain elevated, the higher borrowing costs become, and that could tip the housing market into a recession, according to Wells Fargo.

“After generally improving in the first half of 2023, the residential sector now appears to be contracting alongside the recent move higher in mortgage rates,” Wells Fargo economists wrote in a recently released commentary, titled simply, “Rising Borrowing Costs Stand to Tip the Housing Sector Back Into Recession.”

For the first time in more than two decades, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached 8% in early October. And although rates may decline as the Federal Reserve eases up on its fight against inflation, financing costs will likely remain elevated compared to pandemic lows for the foreseeable future, according to the bank, which reported that prospects for a “housing rebound” are dimming as mortgage rates rise.

Although Wells Fargo did not cite the last housing downturn specifically, Charlie Dougherty, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, and Patrick Barley, an economic analyst at the firm, wrote of the similarities between the current housing climate and the 1980s. They echoed recent research from Bank of America Research and First American, as Fortune reported. For its part, BofA warned of “turbulence” coming that will resemble the 1980s, marked by high mortgage rates as Paul Volcker’s Federal Reserve fought to bring down double-digit inflation. First American suggested that housing had a case of 1980s déjà vu, with high inflation, high interest rates, and homebuyers coming of age—millennials turning into their boomer parents, essentially.

Mortgage rates to move lower, but remain elevated

“A ‘higher for longer’ interest rate environment would likely not only weigh on demand, but could also constrain supply by reducing new construction and discouraging prospective sellers carrying low mortgage rates from listing their homes for sale,” Dougherty and Barley wrote.

Rising borrowing costs are set to further erode affordability, the economists wrote, citing a calculation by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) showing the average principal and interest payment for borrowers using a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was up 26% in August compared to a year prior.

“The increase in monthly payments has far exceeded growth in median family income, which was up 5% over the same period,” Wells Fargo noted. And mortgage rates are up from August, which means even higher monthly payments now.

But it’s not just elevated borrowing costs that have deteriorated affordability—it’s also that home prices have risen over 40% since the onset of the pandemic, including each month so far this year, according to a calculation by CoreLogic, an information, analytics, and data-enabled services provider. Then there’s tightened supply, which, as the Wells Fargo economists noted, is partly due to homeowners holding on to their homes in fear of losing their low mortgage rates in an already under-built market.

Still, assuming Wells Fargo’s forecast that the Fed has finished hiking interest rates and will lower them next year is accurate, mortgage rates should also move lower, Dougherty and Barley wrote. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate would finish off this year at 6.94%, according to Wells Fargo’s national housing outlook. Next year, the bank forecasts the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will be 6.39%—and in 2025, it’ll sink lower still, to 5.70%.

The bank expects worsened affordability in the near term as mortgage rates remain elevated, which will in turn weaken housing activity. Home prices will continue to appreciate at a slightly slower pace because of underlying demand and tight supply, rising 1.8% by the end of this year, as tracked by Case-Shiller, and 2.5% in 2024. In 2025, Wells Fargo forecasts home prices will rise 4.4%.

The so-called lock-in effect has partly pushed existing-home sales to their lowest level in 13 years. But the decline in existing-home sales isn’t exactly surprising, Wells Fargo economists wrote, because housing is “one of the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy.”

That’s why the NAR sent a letter to the Fed earlier this month, urging the institution to stop raising interest rates. The letter, the economists said, is reminiscent of the 1980s when homebuilders sent a piece of lumber to the Fed, asking for help in restoring housing demand via lower interest rates. Wells Fargo expects the pace of existing home sales to rise modestly next year.

“​In September, the count of existing single-family homes available for sale was 1 million, which equates to just 3.4 months of supply at the current sales pace,” the economists wrote, stressing that there is an underlying demand for homes that is keeping prices up, particularly as millennials are in their prime homebuying years. Still, there are signs supply is starting to rise, Wells Fargo economists wrote.

Meanwhile, the new-home sector “appears to be taking the hits from higher rates better in stride,” given new-home sales are up, which can largely be explained by builders offering incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns to attract buyers. Though the success might not last, Wells Fargo expects new-home sales to rise 4% next year."," the housing market due to mortgage rates hovering around 8%, home prices increasing by 40%, and tightened supply due to homeowners holding on to their homes. Although Wells Fargo expects mortgage rates to move lower next year, the long-term outlook is dim for the housing market."

The comments suggest that Scope 3 emissions reporting will likely remain a part of the finalized rule when it is eventually released, although the final formulation of the supply chain emissions reporting requirements remains unclear, with companies and smaller enterprises pushing back on issues including the cost and disruption from complying with the new rules, and Gensler’s own expressed concerns about staying within the SEC’s mandate.

The SEC released its proposed climate disclosure rules in March 2022, which would require U.S. companies to provide information on climate risks facing their businesses, and plans to address those risks, along with metrics detailing the companies’ operational climate footprint, and in some cases emissions emanating across their value chains.

In his remarks, Gensler stressed that the key motivation behind the SEC’s rulemaking was to fulfil its remit to help “investors making investment decisions,” with the climate reporting rules aimed at providing investors with material information in an environment in which companies are already increasingly making climate-related disclosures.

Gensler said:

“In 2021 of the companies listed in the Russell 1000, so roughly those top thousand companies, 81% already make some climate risk disclosures and 57% to Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures – probably grown in 2022, far less one so called Scope 3. Now there’s not consistency, there’s not necessarily comparability there and there’s a role for the SEC to try to bring some consistency and comparability. And that drives efficiency in capital markets because then investors get something consistent.”

Gensler said that the SEC’s proposed climate rule has received significant feedback, including 16,000 comments from companies, investors and other stakeholders, with the rules’ emissions reporting requirements as a key focus area, with “a lot of comments on the Scope 3 reports.” While noting that investors were broadly supportive of Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting and split on Scope 3, issuers had “a lot of questions, doubts and concerns” on the Scope 3 reporting requirements.

In order to address issuer concerns, Gensler noted the SEC’s tiered approach to its Scope 3 reporting requirements, conceding that “Scope 3 isn’t as well-developed yet,” and requiring the disclosure only if the company determines that it is material or has made a public commitment regarding its Scope 3 emissions.

In addition to the issuers’ concerns, Gensler said that the SEC received comments from smaller enterprises and agricultural entities concerned that they would be required to provide emissions reporting to their larger-company customers, despite not being under the remit of the SEC.

Gensler said:

“We’ve got a lot of comments from the agricultural Community the you know rural America that said, ‘look we’re a farmer or rancher that you know we’re not a public company we shouldn’t get caught up in this.’ And I agree with that.”

The SEC chair added that these are the issues that the commission is currently working on for its final rule:

“That’s why staff’s looking through as to how we can ensure that we don’t indirectly sort of do what we can’t do directly – we don’t regulate non-public companies no and we’ve been very clear on that.”

Despite the Scope 3 challenges, however, Gensler was clear that the issue remained important to investors in order for them to manage risk:

“What investors have told us in the comments that they’ve sent us is that understanding the emissions of a company’s supply chain – and this is from investors – understanding the emissions of the supply chain helps understand what’s called transition risk, you know what might be the future for that business. And it might be transition risk because customers may buy different products because of the emissions of a supply chain, or regulations may change, or even employees may want to work for one firm versus another. “The only remit we have at the SEC is through that – is it material?”

Whatever final form the SEC’s rule takes, however, many U.S. public companies will likely find themselves required to provide Scope 3 disclosures under other regulatory reporting regimes. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, recently signed a bill into law which will effectively require large U.S. companies that do business in the state to disclose their full value chain emissions. Similarly, the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) extends the reporting requirements to non-European companies that generate over €150 million in the EU, and also includes Scope 3 reporting. Gensler noted that the requirements imposed by these laws will affect the “economic baseline” of the cost of the SEC’s climate reporting rule, with many companies already required to report on these factors.

Gensler also did not indicate the timeline for the completion of the climate-related reporting rule. Gensler said that “I don’t know when it will be in the Federal Register,” jokingly adding “and I’m not announcing that here.”","oes the emissions of a company’s supply chain is important to them in order to assess the company’s risk.”Investors support the SEC's emissions reporting proposal, saying that it provides them with key information to assess company risk. SEC Chair Gary Gensler acknowledged the comments from companies, investors and other stakeholders, noting that the commission is looking to ensure that non-public companies are not indirectly burdened by the new rules. He made clear that Scope 3 reporting remains important to investors for assessing risk."

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is investigating the companies that manage federal student loans, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

The investigation will center on how the companies dealt with the restart of student loan payments this month following a three-year pause because of the pandemic. Borrowers have complained about long hold times when calling customer service centers and about the guidance loan servicers have provided, including inaccurate payment information.

The CFPB’s education loan ombudsman saw an increase in complaints about student loans in the past year amid several systemic changes to the federal student loan system and the resumption of payments, according to an October report.

“Complaints reveal that borrowers are reaching out to servicers and encountering widespread problems that prevent them from getting the information they need, enrolling in [income-driven repayment] plans, or accessing loan cancellations,” the ombudsman wrote. “They reveal significant servicer errors including inaccurate payment histories and delayed refunds that are owed to borrowers.”

Congress kept the budget for student aid administration flat at $2 billion for this fiscal year despite requests from the Biden administration for more money. That’s led to a budget crunch at the department. Federal loan servicers have laid off staff and cut call center hours in response.

Servicers had warned before the payment restart that the limited funds would lead to extended wait times and servicing delays and that poor planning from the federal government would hamper the restart.","The CFPB is investigating how loan servicers managed the restart of student loan payments this month, following complaints of long hold times when calling customer service centers and inaccurate payment information.

The study was conducted in partnership with Hebrew SeniorLife, a Harvard Medical School-affiliated nonprofit organization serving older adults in the Greater Boston area. It drew on insights from 31 key informational interviews and three focus groups with payers, housing providers, and community partners.

The Right Care, Right Place, Right Time (R3) Program deploys wellness teams in affordable housing sites. These teams include coordinators and nurses who adopt an “eyes-on” approach, training all housing staff to observe and contribute to care coordination for residents. The teams bridge housing and healthcare efforts, supporting residents where they live and aiming for better health outcomes and prolonged independence.

Despite the recognized potential of these programs to enhance the lives of low-income older adults, finding reliable funding sources is a significant hurdle.

Key findings from the study, “Promoting Sustainability in Housing with Services: Insights from the Right Care, Right Place Right Time Program,” include the following:

Recognized Value: Participants unanimously recognized the value of housing-with-services programs in improving the well-being of older adults.

Participants unanimously recognized the value of housing-with-services programs in improving the well-being of older adults. Funding Need: There was little consensus on how to secure ongoing funding for these programs. The responsibility for individuals in housing sites is distributed across health insurers, hospitals, and community service providers, making it challenging to incentivize investment.

There was little consensus on how to secure ongoing funding for these programs. The responsibility for individuals in housing sites is distributed across health insurers, hospitals, and community service providers, making it challenging to incentivize investment. Government’s Role: The study suggests that governmental mechanisms, possibly at the federal level, are needed to channel funding toward supportive services. Without reliable funding sources, replicating these housing models for low-income older people will be difficult.

“The study emphasizes the need for innovative solutions to secure funding for supportive services,” said co-author Marc A. Cohen, co-director, LeadingAge LTSS Center, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts. “Sustaining and financing these models has proven to be a complex issue, given the separate systems of publicly-funded housing and healthcare,” he said.

Housing models that integrate supportive services have proven popular among better-off individuals who can afford private-pay environments. Yet options for older people with fewer resources have remained limited due to scarce public financing. The Section 202 low-income housing program, established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been one option for affordable housing for people aged 62 and older. Service coordinators were added to the program in 1990; yet it has remained limited in scope and poorly funded over the years, leaving many older adults without access to supportive housing environments.

“We expect these findings to contribute to a broader understanding of how housing-with-services models can be developed and maintained to benefit low-income older adults,” said Kim Brooks, chief operating officer, senior living, Hebrew SeniorLife.

The study examined the experiences and perspectives of individuals involved in the Boston-area Right Care, Right Place, Right Time Program, which enrolled 400 older adults across seven intervention sites. Four sites were operated by Hebrew SeniorLife and three were operated by partner providers, including Milton Residences for the Elderly and WinnCompanies.

Lead author of the study was Pamela Nadash, PhD, associate professor, Gerontology Department, University of Massachusetts. Co-authors include Edward Alan Miller, professor and chair, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts; Elizabeth J. Simpson, MPH, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts; Molly Wylie, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts; Natalie Shellito, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts; Yan Lin, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts; Taylor Jansen, PhD, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts; and Marc A. Cohen, co-director, LeadingAge LTSS Center, Department of Gerontology, University of Massachusetts and Center for Consumer Engagement and Health System Transformation, Community Catalyst.

This work was supported by Hebrew SeniorLife, which designed and piloted the R3 program and secured additional funding for the evaluation and intervention. Funders include the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Health Policy Commission Health Care Innovation Investment Program; Beacon Communities LLC; Boston Scientiﬁc Foundation; Coverys Community Healthcare Foundation; Enterprise Community Partners; Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development; Mass Housing; and The Pioneer Institute.

The MAS officially announced on Oct. 30 that it is partnering with the Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA), the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to promote joint digital asset pilots. The authority specifically seeks to carry out such pilots in relation to fixed income, foreign exchange and asset management products.

The initiative builds upon Singapore’s ongoing asset tokenization project known as Project Guardian, which was launched in 2022. Under Project Guardian, Singapore’s central bank collaborated with 15 financial institutions to complete pilots on asset tokenization, which demonstrated a significant potential for transaction efficiency.

“As the pilots grow in scale and sophistication, there is a need for closer cross-border collaboration among policymakers and regulators,” the MAS wrote, adding that the regulator has therefore established a Project Guardian policymaker group comprising the FSA, the FCA and FINMA.

The group aims to initiate policy and accounting discussions and identify potential risks and legal gaps related to digital assets and tokenized solutions. The project also seeks to explore the development of common standards for the design of digital asset networks and find best practices across various jurisdictions. Other work vectors include interoperability, regulatory sandboxes and education related to the digital currency industry.

“MAS’ partnership with the FSA, the FCA and FINMA shows a strong desire among policymakers to deepen our understanding of the opportunities and risks arising from digital asset innovation,” MAS deputy managing director of markets and development, Leong Sing Chiong, said. He added:

“Through this partnership, we hope to promote the development of common standards and regulatory frameworks that can better support cross border interoperability, as well as sustainable growth of the digital asset ecosystem.”

Singapore has been actively collaborating with global financial authorities in the field of digital currency. In September 2023, Singapore MAS completed a joint test of the cross-border trading and settlement of wholesale central bank digital currencies in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements and the central banks of France and Switzerland.

And yet, it seems Gaurav Parkash didn't recognise the danger, or that if he did, he didn't act upon it.

Parkash was promoted to head of Credit Suisse's EMEA banks business in September 2021. He extricated himself from the Credit Suisse husk in August 2023 and has just joined Rothschild's London financial institutions group (FIG) team as a managing director instead.

Parkash spent nearly 16 years at Credit Suisse, having joined after a short spell as a product manager at Citigroup. He was seemingly not in the cohort of Credit Suisse bankers who moved over to UBS at the end of the summer.

Parkash was promoted to his big Credit Suisse FIG job after the bank's previous generation of FIG leaders chose to leave when the bank lost $5.5bn through its involvement with the Archegos family office. Former FIG co-heads Armando Rubio-Alvarez and Max Mesny went to Jefferies and PJT respectively in late 2021. This was perhaps the time to quit.

UBS appears to have selectively culled Credit Suisse's EMEA FIG team. Israel Fernandez Del Sol, the former co-head of all FIG banking in EMEA is currently on gardening leave. However, his co-head Julien Lamm is now at UBS in Paris.

We wish Parkash luck in his new seat at Rothschild. Rothschild has been making a few cuts of its own, but is also hiring selectively.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Statesville financial advisor explains benefits of Roth IRA,https://statesville.com/news/local/finances-investments-roth-ira/article_56ac8c4a-7462-11ee-a7d3-eb460479b9a7.html,"As you save for retirement, you’ll want to take full advantage of the investment vehicles available to you — and one of the best is a Roth IRA. But what sets it apart from other accounts?

Three key factors distinguish the Roth IRA:

Tax-free earnings: When you invest in a Roth IRA, your earnings can grow tax free, provided you don’t begin taking withdrawals until you’re 59½ and you’ve had your account at least five years. If you don’t meet these criteria, withdrawals of earnings will be subject to taxes and a possible 10% penalty.

No penalties on withdrawals of contributions: You fund a Roth IRA with after-tax dollars, which means you can withdraw your contributions — not the earnings — at any time for any reason, without facing taxes or penalties. So, you could use some of your Roth IRA money for non-retirement purposes, such as helping pay for a child’s college education.

No required withdrawals at age 73: With a traditional IRA or a 401(k), you must start taking withdrawals — called required minimum distributions, or RMDs — once you reach 73. But this rule doesn’t apply to a Roth IRA — you can keep it intact as long as you like. You may need to tap into it for some of your retirement income, but if you don’t use it all, the remainder could benefit your beneficiaries.

A Roth IRA does share one similarity to a traditional IRA: It can be funded with virtually any type of investment, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit (CDs) and so on.

However, unlike a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA does have income limits.

For the 2023 tax year, if your modified adjusted gross income was less than $138,000 (for a single filer) or $218,000 (married filing jointly), you can put in the full amount of $6,500 and an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you’re 50 or older. The amounts you can contribute will gradually decline at higher income levels and are phased out entirely at $153,000 for single filers and $228,000 if you’re married and file jointly. These income ranges will likely change for the 2024 tax year, so you’ll want to consult with your tax advisor for details.

Still, even if you’ve contributed to a traditional IRA or a 401(k) for many years, you may have a chance to eventually “convert” some, or all, of these funds to a Roth IRA and gain its benefits. It’s not hard to do this conversion — it involves minimal paperwork from your traditional IRA or 401(k) provider — but it does come with tax issues. Any money that’s converted from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA will be treated as ordinary taxable income. This can trigger a large tax bill, so, unless you have the money available from other accounts to pay the taxes, the conversion may or may not make sense for you. But you don’t have to convert all the funds at once. By spreading the conversion over several years, you could reduce the effect of a large tax hit in any single year. You may want to consult with your tax advisor before converting any funds to a Roth IRA.

If you can find a way to contribute to a Roth IRA, either directly or through a conversion, consider it carefully — you’ll find a lot of upsides to this investment account.","The Roth IRA is a retirement account which allows tax-free growth and allows for withdrawals of contributions without penalty at any time. It differs from a traditional IRA in that there are no required withdrawals at age 73, and there are income limits to contributions. You can convert funds to a Roth IRA, but this comes with tax implications and should be discussed with a tax advisor."

State House Finance Committee members visited Maui last week and toured various ares in the Maui wildfire disaster zone in Lahaina to receive an update on recovery efforts from county and federal officials as well as identify key priorities for the upcoming legislative session.

It was led by Committee Chairman House Rep. Kyle Yamashita of Maui.

One of the areas committee members visited was Mala Wharf which is overseen by the state Department of Land and Natural Resource’s Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation.

Conversations at the wharf focused on potential legislation for the upcoming session, with an emphasis on addressing commercial matters while taking into account the concerns of local residents, a news release said.

Division officials provided an update on the funds received in previous years from the legislature and the status of projects, which include upgrading bathroom facilities, improving lighting, and enhancing the facility’s striping. Additionally, officials indicated that a portion of the ramp is planned for renovation.

Members also received an update from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regarding the West Maui temporary school.

A transitional campus will be located at Pulelehua near Kapalua Airport.

The school will support students who previously attended King Kamehameha III Elementary which was damaged beyond repair. The students are currently receiving their education in a hybrid, temporary environment at Princess Nahi’ena’ena Elementary School. The project is currently in the bid phase,and officials said that they will be reviewing the submission of proposals, which were due last week.

The committee members also toured King Kamehameha III Elementary, Lahaina Harbor and Front Street Apartments.

The apartments are a Hawai’i Housing Finance & Development Corporation, a 142-unit project built in 2001.

It was one of the few affordable housing complexes on Maui, a news release said.

Throughout the 2024 legislative session, there will be anticipated discussions regarding the need for affordable housing for residents, especially in the wake of the Lahaina wildfires, the news release added.

Committee members on Wednesday also toured fire ravaged areas in Upcountry.","Members of the Hawaii House Finance Committee visited Maui last week to tour areas in the wildfire disaster zone and receive an update on recovery efforts from county and federal officials.

Who cares about money matters when you’re in love? Besides, for the father of the bride, just paying for the wedding is enough “financial” matters to worry about!

The sooner a newly-married couple takes care of some important financial issues the better.

If you change your name, you need to notify the Social Security Administration of your new legal name. You will need to provide a photo identification, birth certificate and marriage certificate. Go to www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf to download the Form SS-5 to fill out in advance. Then call your local Social Security office to make an appointment to go in to give them your filled out form SS-5, and the other documentation. It should take about 10 to 14 business days to get your new Social Security card.

Getting your name changed with the Social Security Administration is the first step.

Now you are ready to go to the next step, which is getting a new driver’s license. Take the new Social Security card, along with your current “old” driver’s license to your local DMV to get a new license with your new last name. You should consider taking along your birth certificate and marriage license just in case the folks at the DMV are in a testy mood and showing them such additional documentation may help settle them down.

While you’re at it, go to your bank and get your name changed on your account, perhaps add your spouse to that account, or open a new joint bank account? Having a driver’s license with your new name is important at the bank.

Now let’s talk about estate planning issues. Having a power of attorney (financial and medical) for each of you is VERY important. Having wills is also important. Naming the other spouse as beneficiary on all your accounts (life insurance, annuities, retirement accounts, etc.) is really a good idea while you’re at it.

Adding your spouse to your employer-provided health insurance can be done as soon as you are married. You don’t have to wait until an open-enrollment period. If both of you have health insurance coverage, compare each plan and perhaps choose the one that is best for both of you.

Within 10 days of getting married, you should provide your employers with updated form W-4s indicating you are married so they change the tax withholding ASAP. Married rates are lower than single, so this should increase each paycheck net take-home pay.

Keeping financial matters in line can be a way to make a marriage run smoother and hey! It can roll back into that love thing. Know what I mean?

Have you heard? Prov 15:17 says, “Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a fattened calf with hatred.”

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Does MRS Oil's financial performance justify its share price rally ...,https://nairametrics.com/2023/10/30/does-mrs-oils-financial-performance-justify-its-share-price-rally/,"In 2022, MRS Oil’s stock outperformed the broad market with a YtD return of 28.42%, compared to the NGX All-Share Index (NGXASI) return of 19.98%.

The stock began the year at N10.98 per share and closed at N14.10 per share.

In the current year, MRS Oil has exhibited exceptional performance, with its share price surging by an impressive 680%, ranking it as the third best-performing stock on the NGX in terms of year-to-date (YtD) share price appreciation.

The key question is whether the company’s financial performance supports the ongoing share price rally.

The recently disclosed Q3 2023 results reveal significant growth in both revenue and profitability. The financial data indicates a 55.64% year-on-year growth in Q3 revenue, reaching N41.229 billion.

This took the nine-month revenue to N100.878 billion versus N69.150 billion in the same period last year.

Quarterly and nine-month operating, pre-tax, and post-tax profits have maintained a high level. Q3 post-tax profit surged by an impressive 161.32% to N1.132 billion, contributing to a substantial 338.52% year-on-year growth in nine-month post-tax profit, totalling N3.443 billion.

In fact, the nine-month results have surpassed the entire 2023 forecast across the top line, middle line, and bottom line.

According to the company’s forward-looking statement, it anticipates achieving a sales volume of 651 million liters and a profit after tax of N1.01 billion, reflecting a 164% increase over the 2022 forecast.

Furthermore, the company aims for a target revenue of N127.87 billion, with an estimated gross profit of N7.03 billion and aggregate expenditures of N6.18 billion, ultimately resulting in a profit after tax of N 1.47 billion.

The fact that MRS Oil’s performance has surpassed its own forecasts is indeed a positive sign.

When a company consistently outperforms its own expectations, it can boost investor confidence and potentially attract more interest from the market.

However, while surpassing forecasts is undoubtedly a positive indicator, the presence of low-profit margins can trigger concerns among potential investors.

In the period under review, MRS Oil recorded a limited profit margin.

This can be primarily attributed to a significant increase in the cost of sales and overall expenses.

For instance, the substantial growth in the cost of sales, particularly during Q3, which led to a decrease in the gross margin to 4.9%, had a dampening impact on the nine-month gross profit margin, reducing it to 10.84%.

In Q3, the cost of sales experienced a considerable year-on-year increase of 63.36%, reaching N39.208 billion, surpassing the growth rate of revenue. This implies that the company encountered escalated operational costs in Q3.

Furthermore, the nine-month aggregate expenditures also exceeded expectations, even surpassing the company’s full-year aggregate expenditures forecast of N6.18 billion

As a result, the net profit margin for the nine-month period was reported at 3.41%.

This figure signifies that MRS Oil retained approximately 3.41% of its total revenue as profit after considering all expenses, including operating costs, interest, taxes, and other deductions, over the specified period.

While the company’s performance has positive aspects, the net profit margin of 3.41% indicates limited profitability. This margin essentially means that for every N100 of revenue generated, MRS Oil retains N3.41 as profit, which is relatively low.

This can be a concern for investors, as it suggests that a significant portion of the company’s revenue is being absorbed by expenses, potentially leaving a smaller cushion for financial stability.

While low profit margins may not be the sole determinant of a share price rally, they are a critical component of a company’s financial health. Investors may be willing to tolerate lower margins if they believe in the company’s growth potential and strategies to improve profitability.

The company’s management, operational efficiency, and ability to execute its strategies also play crucial roles in shaping investor sentiment and share price movements.

Additionally, how heavily or thinly traded a stock is can justify a share price rally.

The trading volume and liquidity of a stock can significantly impact its share price movement.

MRS Oil’s share trading data indicates that it is actively traded with a reasonable level of market participation. MRS Oil is ranked as the 110th most traded stock on the Nigerian Stock Exchange over the past three months. It has traded a total volume of 4.88 million shares during this period, with an average of 77,431 shares traded per session.

While it may not be among the highest-traded stocks, it is still actively traded, indicating investor interest.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,1 in 9 men. | Featured News Story | Verizon,https://www.verizon.com/about/news/speed-october-30-2023,"As we wrap up Domestic Violence Awareness Month, data from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence report that one in four women and one in nine men have experienced some form of physical violence, sexual abuse, or stalking by an intimate partner. On today’s edition of Up To Speed, meet V Teamer Alfred Hill, an Assistant Manager in Houston, Texas who bravely shared his experience as a domestic violence survivor.

Alfred and his wife of more than 28 years met in Houston, choosing to raise their family in the city. Over the first few years, the family spent plenty of quality time together, going on vacations, attending sporting events and exposing his children to plenty of positive energy — all that changed after 10 years.

“It took a nasty turn,” Alfred said. “[His wife became] very aggressive, in my face, really provoking, saying negative things. I felt like I was a horrible father because I heard it over and over and over again.”

Enough is enough

Alfred says his wife would criticize his job and his weight. It wasn’t until his daughter had a breakdown and suicidal ideations that he decided enough is enough.

It was a tough step for Alfred. “If I wasn’t going through therapy with a good support group, I wouldn’t be here right now,” he said.

The police came to Alfred’s house several times, due to threats. Finally, Alfred realized he had to leave or risk something terrible happening. That’s when Alfred decided to call Verizon’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The program provided him with many of the resources he needed, including monetary assistance through Verizon’s VtoV program.

“Verizon, they really care — if they didn’t help me, I would’ve had to move in with my brother,” said Alfred. “I didn’t have any additional funds when I originally reached out to EAP.”

His advice to V Teamers, men or women who are struggling in an abusive relationship is to reach out for help: EAP is a simple and confidential resource.

“You will be surprised with the resources that can help you transition to get better.”

With at least 83 closures this year alone, The Daily Mail reports that New Jersey has had the highest number of bank branch closures per capita in the United States.

Over the past three years, 10% of all bank branches in New Jersey have closed.

The closures are coming from both big and small banks.

Impact of bank closures in New Jersey

Most banks are accelerating efforts to provide most transactions on-line, but there are some populations in New Jersey that either to not have access to secure internet or simply prefer to access banking services in person.

The closures are also hitting already underserved communities the hardest.

Research from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that a third of the locations that had been closed nationwide were in minority areas an/or areas where there was a predominantly lower income level.

Some consumer advocates warn that makes those communities more susceptible to predatory lending practices.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Cops were sent to Maine gunman’s home weeks before massacres ... - Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/cops-were-sent-maine-gunman-000853668.html,"The Maine National Guard asked local police to check on the reservist who killed 18 people after a soldier became concerned he would “snap and commit a mass shooting,” according to information shared with CNN.

Officers from the Sagadahoc County and Kennebec County Sheriff’s Offices responded and tried to contact the man on September 16, less than six weeks before Wednesday’s massacres in a bowling alley and a bar, documents say, according to a law enforcement source.

The information obtained by CNN describes how the Sagadahoc County sergeant called for backup, tried without success to talk to the reservist and then received disturbing details from the Maine National Guard and the shooter’s family.

The responding sergeant from the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office was told “when [he] answers the door at his trailer, in the past he usually does so with a handgun in hand out of view from the person outside,” according to the source familiar with the welfare check report.

The responding officer learned later in a letter from the National Guard that a fellow guardsman “is concerned that [the reservist] is going to snap and commit a mass shooting,” according to the report filed in connection with the wellness check.

The 40-year-old went on two shooting rampages in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, killing 18 people at Just-in-Time Recreation and at Schemengees Bar & Grille.

The initial panic was followed by 48 hours of fear and lockdown before he was found on Friday night, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, about 10 miles away.

CNN’s reporting raises new questions about the lack of follow-through to make sure the man was not a danger despite serious warning signs that were known by authorities and are now being detailed for the first time.

Maine has a “yellow flag” law that can be used to assess an individual with access to weapons. The first step is for law enforcement to take someone believed to be dangerous into custody and then have them evaluated by a medical professional. After a diagnosis, a judge can approve an order to temporarily remove firearms, according to the law.

A File 6 missing person’s report appears to have been generated by the Sagadahoc sergeant who tried to check on the man, the source told CNN, but it is unclear if there was any action in regard to the shooter’s access to weapons. The source said the case appeared to have been closed on October 1, 24 days before the massacres.

CNN started raising questions about what information all law enforcement in the state had about threats and the mental health condition of the shooter on Thursday. But when CNN asked State Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck about it, he replied: “I won’t answer.”

He continued: “Based on what I’ve seen, we’re going to continue to work through that.”

A spokesperson for the state police on Sunday said the organization was the lead agency for the manhunt and homicide investigations but no other aspect, directing CNN to ask questions about what was known before to Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry.

“The Department of Public Safety (DPS) nor the Maine State Police requested a teletype on Robert Card prior to October 26. It should also be noted that no bulletins or assistance was requested from MSP’s Maine information and analysis center. DPS has no regulatory authority over law-enforcement agencies in Maine,” she said, declining to give any elaboration.

CNN was unable to reach Merry on Sunday. A woman who answered the door at his home said he was “done,” indicating he did not want to speak.

CNN also tried to request comments on this story from the shooter’s family and the Maine National Guard, who were closely involved in the September attempts to check on the man’s welfare. Neither has responded.

Parking lot threats

Soon after the man – Robert Card – was identified as the suspect, his mental health struggles were also reported.

According to information apparently supplied to Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office by the Maine National Guard, the man spent 14 days at a psychiatric hospital in July before being released.

That hospital stay was prompted after he had trouble with other soldiers in New York state in July.

The National Guard told the Sagadahoc sheriff’s office their reservist had begun hearing insulting voices in the spring, and they had only gotten worse.

On July 15 near West Point, he and other soldiers “had gone to a convenience store to get some beer,” according to information shared with CNN, quoting a National Guard letter.

“In the parking lot [he] accused three of them of calling him a pedophile and said he would take care of it,” it went on. “One of the soldiers who had been friends with [him] for a long time was there. [He] got in his face, shoved him, and told him to stop calling him a pedophile.”

The law enforcement source told CNN they said they calmed their comrade down, got back to the motel, where he locked himself in his room and would not respond.

The next day, another guardsman got the key to his room and saw him. “[He] told me to leave him alone and tried to slam the door in my face,” the report quoted him as saying, adding that the guardsman took the man to a base hospital where a psychologist determined he needed further treatment, which led to the 14-day psychiatric stay.

Punching a soldier

After his release, there was another incident that led to the Maine National Guard calling for a well-being check.

The man and a friend who was a soldier were driving home from a casino when he started talking about people calling him a pedophile, the National Guard statement to Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office said.

“When [his friend] told him to knock it off because he was going to get into trouble talking about shooting up places and people, [he] punched him,” the statement said. “According to [the friend], [he] said he has guns and is going to shoot up the drill center at Saco and other places … [the friend] is concerned that [he] is going to snap and commit a mass shooting.”

The threat to the National Guard facility in Saco led to some extra patrols, Saco Police Chief Jack Clements told WMTW Maine, but the troubled guardsman never showed up.

Sagadahoc County Sheriff Merry told The New York Times he sent an alert to all law enforcement agencies in Maine sometime in September after learning of the threat to the Saco base.

CNN had not been able to independently verify that.

Merry told The Associated Press it was the Army Reserve who tipped him off to the possible danger.

An Army spokesperson told CNN Card’s unit had requested a health and welfare check from the sheriff’s office.

“In September, the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s office responded to a health and welfare check requested by Sgt. 1st Class Robert Card’s unit out of an abundance of caution after the unit became concerned for his safety,” Lt. Col. Ruth Castro said. “The Army takes all allegations seriously. Due to an ongoing Army investigation, we cannot go into any further details.”

Investigators said the shooter already had the high-powered Ruger SFAR rifle later used in the killings by then, having bought it and a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol earlier in July.

Brother told police the family could secure the weapons

When the Sagadahoc and Kennebec officers were deployed to his home on September 16, they did not make contact with the shooter but soon learned of his mental health problems and his guns, the law enforcement source told CNN.

The reservist would not answer the door to officers, the source said, so officers started to make calls to those who knew him.

The unit commander told one officer that the man no longer had any Guard weapons and arrangements had been made with his brother who had retrieved his personal firearms.

The commander also reportedly told the officer that he thought it best to let the man have time to himself.

The following day, the Sagadahoc officer spoke with the shooter’s brother, who warned him that the man would likely be armed if he did answer the door.

“I was later contacted by [the brother,] he told me that between him and his father they would work to ensure that [the man] does not have access to any firearms. They have a way to secure his weapons,” the source quoted from a welfare check report.

The responding police officer said he told the brother that the intention was to make sure his sibling did not hurt himself or others. He said his department would help to facilitate a mental health evaluation if needed.

That was on September 17. Thirty-eight days later, the National Guard reservist walked into a bowling alley and started shooting. A 14-year-old boy playing with his father and contestants in a cornhole tournament for the deaf were among those killed. He then went to a bar and killed more, including the manager who tried to stop him.

CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,"Police: 15 people shot, 2 critically injured, after mass shooting in ...",https://news.yahoo.com/police-15-people-shot-2-014700178.html,"CHICAGO — At least 15 people were injured, two critically, in a mass shooting at a Halloween party early Sunday morning in North Lawndale, according to Chicago police.

The attack represented the highest number of victims wounded in a Chicago shooting since March 2021 when 15 people were shot at a party in Park Manor, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

A man fired into the Halloween party with around 100 attendees inside a building in the 1200 block of South Pulaski Road shortly after 1 a.m., police said. The gunman fled, but officers quickly arrested him nearby with help from partygoers and found a gun in his possession. He has not yet been charged, police said.

The suspect had been kicked out of the party earlier, 10th District Cmdr. William Betancourt said at a news conference at the scene Sunday afternoon.

“He came back a few minutes later with a gun and began to shoot,” Betancourt said.

Outside the two-story brick building where the shooting took place, red solo cups lay atop wet leaves Sunday afternoon. Inside the mostly empty room where people had gathered, a costume mask with what looked like fake blood was left on the ground, a puddle of apparently real blood next to it.

Almost no one was at the scene Sunday morning, but around 40 anti-violence activists, police leaders, politicians and clergy arrived for the afternoon news conference and a subsequent short prayer vigil.

Officials shared few details at the news conference about the condition of the people shot. Some victims are still hospitalized, but most were initially transported to hospitals in “good” or “fair” condition, Betancourt said. The victims range in age from 26 to 53. Six women and nine men were shot, police said.

The two victims in critical condition, a 26-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man, were taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. The woman was shot in the left hip and right buttocks, and the man was shot in his right hip, right thigh and twice in the left thigh, police said.

The location where the gathering took place has a history of throwing unlicensed events, Betancourt said. A sign on the building said Studio 1258. Betancourt described the company that operates there as a licensed art gallery.

The spot was shut down May 6 for a party that did not have a permit, said Ivan Capifali, first deputy commissioner for the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. The department will investigate to see if the people who threw the gathering Saturday night violated laws, Capifali said.

Ald. Monique Scott, 24th, spoke directly to the “bad guy” when she addressed reporters.

“This has to stop. At what point does it stop?” she asked.

North Lawndale has seen a 9% drop in murders in the last year, a decline roughly in line with citywide trends, according to police data. However, crimes including robbery and motor vehicle theft are sharply up this year. The West Side neighborhood has one of the highest rates of people shot in the city, according to CPD data.

It was lucky that no one was killed in the shooting, Scott said, but the trauma for the many partygoers who witnessed the attack can’t be normalized, she added.

“I don’t know whether to scream or to cry. We shouldn’t be out here,” Scott said.

Mayor Brandon Johnson shared his support for the victims in a statement Sunday.

The city will work with community groups and faith leaders and “ensure that victims and survivors have the resources they need to address trauma,” he said in the statement. “As long as I am mayor, Chicago will continue to lead the call for common sense gun reform to bring safety to all communities,” he added.

CPD brass said they are focused on addressing trauma related to the attack. Beginning Tuesday, the department plans to operate an emergency assistance center at the nonprofit YMEN’s building across the street, CPD community policing Director Glen Brooks said. People affected by the Sunday attack and other shootings will be able to connect at the center with the department’s victim services program, as well as religious and nonprofit groups, Brooks said.

“We can hold people accountable, but we have to heal as a community if we want to stop this cycle of violence,” Brooks said. “When you have the physical pain, that’s one, but the trauma that comes after it is long lasting. If we don’t address this, we know hurt people can hurt other people. So we’re trying to break that cycle.”

Last Halloween in nearby East Garfield Park, a drive-by mass shooting left 14 people shot, one fatally. The victims had been attending a vigil for a friend who died of surgery complications.

In a report published Sunday, victims told the Tribune that although they heard promising commitments in the days after the 2022 shooting, they ultimately received little support from government, leaving them to face enduring physical pain, major financial losses and lasting trauma largely alone.

Sunday’s shooting is the 39th shooting in Chicago in which four or more people were shot since Oct. 31 last year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

The block where the Sunday shooting occurred is home to local businesses, several churches and a Christian school serving kids from pre-K through eighth grade. The youth-focused nonprofit YMEN Chicago has a building across the street from where the shooting took place, as well as a pepper garden and a bicycle lending library on the opposite corner.

Hundreds of children come to the block every day, YMEN Executive Director Mike Trout said. The building where the shooting took place has repeatedly held large, nighttime parties in the past, he told the Tribune. The shooting only motivates him to continue his work, he said.

“It just fires me up,” Trout said. “I don’t want that to become the narrative about 14th and Pulaski when every day we try to make this a beautiful and safe space for young people.”

Clergy, police and anti-violence activists, many with the group Black Men United, held hands and prayed in a circle at the intersection after the police news conference. They called on God to stop gun violence as they stood in the cold, light rain.

The crowd quickly left after the prayers. Within a few minutes, no police, news reporters or activists were left at the scene. Few signs of the tragedy that occurred just hours earlier were left.

There was a single bullet hole in the building’s front window, apparently fired from the inside out, and a single high-heeled shoe made of clear plastic left on the sidewalk.

The suspect, who had been kicked out of the party earlier, was quickly arrested with help from partygoers and police found a gun in his possession. The victims range in age from 26 to 53, and six women and nine men were shot."

Defense Minister Shoigu said Monday the United States is fueling geopolitical tensions to uphold its ""hegemony"" and warned of the risk of confrontation between major countries.

BEIJING (AP) — Russia’s defense minister accused the United States on Monday of fueling geopolitical tensions to uphold its “global dominance by any means” and warned of the risk of confrontation between nuclear-armed countries.

Speaking at a defense forum in Beijing, Sergei Shoigu also accused NATO of trying to expand its footprint in the Asia-Pacific under the pretense of seeking dialogue and collaboration with regional countries.

""Washington for years has deliberately undermined and destroyed the foundations of international security and strategic stability, including the system of arms control agreements,” Shoigu said at the Xiangshan Forum, China’s biggest annual event centered on military diplomacy.

He added that the U.S. and its Western allies are threatening Russia through NATO’s expansion ""to the east.” Shoigu also reiterated Moscow’s stance that Russia was open to negotiations about the war in Ukraine under what he described as the right conditions.

“The Western line of steady escalation of the conflict with Russia carries the threat of a direct military clash between nuclear powers, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences,” he said.

Shoigu's speech followed that of Zhang Youxia, China’s second-ranking military official and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, who opened the three-day event in the absence of former defense minister Gen. Li Shangfu, who would have normally hosted the event.

Li was removed from his position last week after a two-month absence from public view. The government has not provided any reason for his removal.

The Beijing event, attended by military representatives from dozens of countries, is an occasion for China to project regional leadership and boost military cooperation. The U.S. is represented by a delegation led by Xanthi Carras, the Defense Department’s leading official on China.

Zhang said China was “willing to develop military ties with the U.S. on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.”

China suspended military communication with the U.S. in August 2022 to show its displeasure over a visit by former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.

Without directly naming the U.S., Zhang criticized “certain countries” that “keep stirring up troubles around the world.”

He also urged for “an immediate cease-fire"" in the latest Israel-Hamas war, sparked by the Palestinian militant group's deadly Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel, and called for a ""resumption of peace talks” between Israel and the Palestinians.

China claims it's neutral in Russia's war on Ukraine but maintains close ties with Russia, with frequent state visits and joint military drills between the two nations. It has similarly sought to project a mediator role in the Israel-Hamas war, though experts say Beijing's influence in the conflict is limited.

Zhang reiterated threats by the Chinese government regarding any efforts toward Taiwan’s independence, saying that “no matter who tries to split Taiwan from China in any form, China and the Chinese military will never allow that to happen.”

FOX 7 Austin's John Krinjak spoke with Austin-based defense attorney Rick Flores to look ahead to the trial.

JOHN KRINJAK: So this is obviously such a high-profile case. It was a murder that made national attention when it happened. We have a young pro cyclist who was the victim. How could that all play into this case when things get underway on Monday?

RICK FLORES: Sure. So on Monday, jury selection will begin, and it'll be interesting to see how both sides, the state and the defense, try to find 12 impartial jurors. Certainly a lot of people have heard about this. As you mentioned, it made national news. And there's a lot of people who know a lot of the details, too many of the details, to be fair and impartial. So it'll be interesting to see when the trial starts on Monday, and they're doing jury selection, how to weed those people out. Tuesday will be the opening statements, and that's what I'm excited to see, because that's really kind of a preview of what both sides are going to be presenting to the jury.

JOHN KRINJAK: And one things that's obviously on our minds here in Austin is that fact that Armstrong tried to escape from authorities. She was on her way to a doctor's appointment, and she didn't make it very far, but it was an escape attempt. How to you think that could play into what we see unfold? Obviously we're going to see new charges added, but what else could we see?

RICK FLORES: Right. So there's already been new charges added. I think it's going to be an issue at this trial for the murder case. The prosecution is going to try to get that in. And the defense is, of course, going to try to keep that out. I think the defense would probably argue that it's too remote from the time of the actual murder, and I think that the prosecution is going to say that it's very relevant, and that it's a sign of her consciousness of guilt.

JOHN KRINJAK: And not just this escape attempt. Obviously, we're talking about Costa Rica. She was arrested in Costa Rica back in June of 2022, which was closer in time to the murder. Do you think the prosecution will try to use that and sort of establish a pattern here, sort of paint her as guilty?

RICK FLORES: That will, without a doubt, be a part of the trial. The prosecution is going to, of course, want the jury to hear all of those details. Like you said, the fact that she escaped out of Texas and then to Costa Rica, she sold her Jeep, she even had plastic surgery, cut her hair, dyed her hair. I mean, all of those things are going to be very difficult for her defense team to explain why she did that. I don't know if anybody's going to be able to get around the idea that those aren't exactly the actions of an innocent person.

KAITLYN ARMSTRONG MURDER TRIAL

JOHN KRINJAK: And that goes to my next question. As a defense attorney, what would be your strategy? How would you come at this case strategically?

RICK FLORES: You know, a lot of people often forget that the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and that the defense doesn't really have to present any sort of theory or evidence. If they wanted to, they could just sit there and let the prosecution present all of the evidence. But in a case like this, the jury is certainly going to be wanting an explanation of why those things happened. And so it'll be interesting to see what sort of theory the defense puts forward. And I don't know if that's going to be that she didn't do it, that they got the wrong person, or that there was some sort of an argument. Whenever there's a murder involved, there's always the possibility of a self-defense claim. And I don't think we've really been presented with any of that. I haven't read anything like that, or heard anything around the courthouse. So it'll be interesting to see what the actual defensive theory is.

JOHN KRINJAK: Obviously, the defense could have a challenging case here, but do you think one of their advantages could be the fact that there's not really a lot of direct evidence here? It's more circumstantial.

RICK FLORES: Right. And whenever you're dealing with a jury trial, you're dealing with people who don't really know a lot about the legal system and want just common sense explanations. And oftentimes when there's no direct evidence, there's no eyewitness, there's no video of the murder. Sometimes that's enough for a jury to hang their hat on and acquit somebody.

Keep up with our coverage of the trial by tuning into FOX 7 Austin News and online at FOX7Austin.com."," any of the discovery yet, so I don't know.

Former basketball star Magic Johnson has been declared a billionaire by Forbes, making him only the fourth athlete to join the exclusive club.

The business magazine estimates Johnson's wealth at about $1.2bn (£990m).

The other athlete billionaires are NBA players Michael Jordan and Lebron James, and the golfer Tiger Woods .

Johnson has investments in numerous companies including ownership stakes in various sports teams.

But Forbes says his stake in a life insurance company holds most of his wealth.

The 64-year-old had one of the most iconic careers in NBA history before retiring in 1996, but it was outside of sport where he made most of his money.

Forbes states that Johnson made $40m from his NBA career.

Johnson has ownership stakes in three Los Angeles-based sports teams, including MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers.

Outside of sport he has investments in Starbucks, Burger King, 24 Hour Fitness and the life insurance company EquiTrust.

Johnson says he could have become a billionaire sooner had he not turned down shares in Nike when he was entering the NBA in the 1970s. He took a deal with Converse, which offered him $100,000 a year, instead.

""My family didn't come from money, that's one thing that hurt us sometimes. When you don't come from money, you don't know. I didn't even know what stocks [were] at that time,"" Johnson said on the All The Smoke podcast earlier this year.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Archaeologists Find the Book of the Dead in an Egyptian Cemetery,https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a45641326/archaeologists-find-book-of-the-dead-in-egyptian-cemetery/,"Egyptian archaeologists recently located a lost 3,500-year-old cemetery containing mummies and statues—among other discoveries.

A particularly exciting find was a Book of the Dead papyrus scroll measuring over 43 feet long—a rare surviving copy of the traditional burial item.

The team behind the find was mum on the details of the textual discovery.

Ancient Egyptians sure knew how to create a burial scene—curated resting places complete with canopic jars holding the organs of the deceased and a Book of the Dead scroll with text meant to help navigate the world beyond the grave.

One of those scenes was recently located in central Egypt, when archaeologists discovered a New Kingdom cemetery that dates back to more than 3,500 years ago and features mummies, canopic jars, amulets, statues, and a papyrus scroll containing a portion of the Book of the Dead that measures more than 43 feet long.

This scroll is the first complete papyrus found in the Al-Ghuraifa area, and is “characterized by being in good condition,” Mustafa Waziri, secretary general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in a translated Arabic statement from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

While the cemetery—dating to sometime between 1550 BC to 1070 BC—was significant for the hundreds of archaeological finds and tombs carved into the rock located within its boundaries, the discovery of what could be a copy of the Book of the Dead captured the attention of experts as a truly rare find. But with few details released to the public about the contents of the scroll—believed to be 43 to 49 feet in length—there’s plenty of questions remaining about this particular copy of the traditional Egyptian cultural book.

These texts—which can differ depending on the writer—first appeared at the start of the New Kingdom around 1550 BC. As a result, locating one in “good condition” from the era isn’t a common occurrence.

“If it’s that long and well-preserved [then it’s] certainly a great and interesting find,” Lara Weiss, CEO of the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Germany, told Live Science. Foy Scalf, an Egyptologist at The University of Chicago tells Live Science that it’s “very rare” to find a copy in the grave it was originally buried in—although, without photographs and an official publication describing the text, it's hard to verify the details of the find.

A book more properly translated as “The Chapters/Book of Going Forth By Day” played a key role in ancient Egyptian culture. Any examples of the text give researchers insight into ancient Egyptian religion and beliefs about an afterlife, according to the American Research Center in Egypt.

“The Book of the Dead reveals central aspects of the ancient Egyptians’ belief system,” the center writes, “and, like many topics in Egyptology, our theories are constantly changing, growing, and adapting with every new translation of this text.”

While the Book of the Dead may continue to interest researchers—the Egyptian ministry says they expect the scroll to be displayed in the Grand Egyptian Museum—the text wasn’t the only item found in the burial chambers.

The team located stone and wood coffins containing mummies, more than 25,000 ushabti statues, an untold number of utensils, thousands of stone and wooden amulets, and canopic jars. The engraved and colored wooden coffins—including that of Ta-de-Isa, daughter of Eret Haru, the high priest of Djehuti in Al-Ashmunin—were highlights of the collection. Next to her coffin were two wooden boxes with her canopic vessels, in addition to a complete set of ushabti statues and a statue of the ostrich-like deity, Ptah Sokar.","Egyptian archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old cemetery with mummies, statues, canopic jars, amulets, and a rare, 43-foot-long papyrus scroll containing a portion of the Book of the Dead.

The Financial Strength Rating (FSR) for Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company and Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity Insurance Company was upgraded to A- (Excellent) from B++ (Good) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICRs) to “a-” (Excellent) from “bbb+” (Good).

These companies are domiciled in Hartford, CT. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) of Talcott Life Re, Ltd. (Bermuda). These companies are collectively referred to as Talcott Financial Group (TFG).

Additionally, the agency has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb-” (Good) of Talcott Resolution Life, Inc. (Delaware), along with its Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs).

According to the announcement, these rating moves reflect TFG’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).

TFG has established itself quickly as a major player in the life and annuity reinsurance space with several large transactions completed since the group was acquired by Sixth Street, a global investment firm, in June 2021.

According to Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), the group has remained in a favourable risk-adjusted capital position. This was bolstered further by a strong liquidity framework that can provide substantial funds under several key economic stress scenarios.

AM Best noted that TFG’s ERM framework is well-established and continues to evolve with emerging risks.

While no transactions have been initialised in 2023, the growth provided by deals over the previous two years has the group managing approximately $123 billion in assets with operational gains beginning to be realised when removing for asset value fluctuations driven by the rise in interest rates.

Despite the very competitive market environment, AM Best believes that TFG will remain well-capitalised and will maintain its current business strategy of growing its platform by providing risk-transfer solutions to the insurance industry through reinsurance or legal entity acquisitions.","AM Best upgraded the credit ratings of Talcott Resolution Life, Inc.’s subsidiaries, Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company and Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity Insurance Company, and gave them a stable outlook.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Hostage negotiations stall over Hamas demand for fuel ... - Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/hostage-negotiations-stall-over-hamas-025016834.html,"DOHA, Qatar — Talks to free some of the 239 hostages held by Hamas stalled Friday after the group demanded that Israel allow fuel deliveries to Gaza and Hamas declined to guarantee the release of a large number of foreign captives, a former U.S. official with knowledge of the negotiations said.

""Hamas has been insistent on receiving fuel,"" said the former U.S. official, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk publicly. ""The Israel and U.S. side, plus other countries, want a large batch of their citizens released.""

The former U.S. official, an Israeli official and a diplomat with knowledge of the talks said discussions broke down before Israel launched the second phase of its offensive Friday evening and sent ground troops into Gaza.

“Talks were going very well on Thursday, and negotiators were hopeful a deal could be reached over the weekend,"" said the diplomat with knowledge of the talks, who also was not authorized to talk publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""But differences emerged early Friday, which led to talks stalling.”

The negotiations to free the 239 hostages, including children and the elderly, have been ongoing since Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise terrorist arrack killed more than 1,000 Israeli civilians. After Hamas breached Israel's border wall, other groups from Gaza seized captives as well.

Roughly half of the captives are believed to be individuals with passports from as many as 25 foreign countries, including an estimated 54 Thais, 15 Argentines, 12 Americans, 12 Germans, six French and six Russians.

Earlier talks, mediated by Qatar, resulted in the releases of four hostages, two Americans and two elderly women, on two separate days.

Public statements by White House officials Friday, in hindsight, appeared to be part of an effort to get U.S. hostages out. “We would support humanitarian pauses for stuff getting in, as well as for people getting out,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday. “That includes pushing for fuel to get in and for the restoration of electrical power.”

Jason Straziuso, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, which acted as an intermediary in the first two hostage releases, said enormous levels of trust would be needed for a large number of captives to be freed.

""With a large group, the logistics just become that much more difficult. There’s a limit to how many people we can put in a Red Cross Land Cruiser. There’s a limit to how many vehicles we have in Gaza. There’s a limit to how much fuel we have right now,"" Straziuso said. ""A large-scale release will take a lot more planning, a lot more faith between the sides, a lot more trust that it can happen without incident.""

By Friday evening, trust had evaporated. Israeli officials accused Hamas of dragging out the negotiations to delay a ground invasion. They bluntly dismissed reports of progress in hostage talks. ""I suggest do not pay attention to the rumors,"" said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. ""This is psychological terror by Hamas.""

After Israel’s bombing and ground operations in Gaza intensified Friday night, a Hamas spokesman, Dr. Basem Naim, told NBC News on Saturday, “You can’t talk about negotiations while they are slaughtering our people.”

Later in the day, Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, said in a statement on the group’s website that it was willing to continue to negotiate. “We are ready for an immediate exchange deal that includes the release of all prisoners in the prisons of the Zionist enemy,"" Sinwar said, ""in exchange for the release of all prisoners with the resistance.”

The Times of Israel reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a news conference Saturday night that an exchange of all Palestinians jailed for security offenses for the captives held in Gaza was among the options Israel is considering.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters that intensifying Israeli attacks was the best way to free captives. “The more we hit out at [Hamas], we know that they will be willing to come to some kind of agreement,” Gallant said, “and we will be able to bring our dearly beloved hostages home.”

Negotiators said they remained hopeful. The former U.S. official said the talks were at a ""temporary impasse."" The diplomat with knowledge of the talks added, ""The escalation has slowed down talks, but they’re still ongoing.""

Keir Simmons reported from Doha, Ken Dilanian reported from Washington and Josh Lederman reported from Tel Aviv.

The headline of this article has been updated to clarify that talks are continuing after stalling on Friday.

Sunday, the Gaza Health Ministry reported the Palestinian death toll topped 8,000, many of them woman and children, as Israel continued its air assault and expanded its ground offensive into Gaza.

Worcester city councilors speak at rally: Jewish leader troubled

Worcester City Councilors Etel Haxhiaj and Thu Nguyen spoke at the rally. Haxhiaj said her ""heart was shattered"" by what is happening in Gaza, called for elected officials to support more humanitarian aid to the region and rejected ""all acts of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.""

Hundreds attended Sunday's Palestine Peace Rally in front of City Hall holding signs and waving the de facto national flag of Palestine as several speakers demanded an end to the death and destruction in the Gaza Strip from a war between Hamas and Israel that is more than three weeks old.

Nguyen condemned the ""violent acts of the Israeli government,"" and said U.S. tax dollars supporting violence perpetrated by Israel means American's have ""blood on our hands to allow this to continue.""

Steven Schimmel, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Central Massachusetts, attended the rally and was troubled by Haxhiaj's and Nguyen's participation.

""Aggressive, hostile and frightening,"" is how Schimmel described all the speeches including those given by the councilors: ""You might think that this rally could be the sort of thing calling for peace, but certainly not this. In fact, it was the opposite. It was clear to me what was being said and I am certainly discomforted by it, especially the city councilors who took part in it.""

Schimmel said he witnessed rally-goes tearing down flyers on public utility poles that showed pictures of Israelis that suffered atrocities at the hands of Hamas militants Oct. 7. He also didn't hear any speakers condemn those deadly acts.

""There was a good opportunity to do that publicly,"" said Schimmel. ""The severity of those attacks is unparalleled.""

Speaker: War won't end unless Palestinian humanity is achieved

Muhammad Xhemali, director of religious affairs at the Worcester Islamic Center, spoke at the rally and stressed that Palestinians deserve the full spectrum of humanity. Until they get it, Xhemali said there is likely no end to the current war.

""Without that aspect (of humanity) being addressed, there is not a single proposed solution that will work because it is within our humanity to aspire for freedom,"" said Xhemali. ""So until that issue is addressed, whether there be one state, two states, people who are equally represented in that land, with the ability to all pursue happiness, just like what we would want for anyone else in this country. Until that ability is rendered to those people, there's never going to be a pathway to peace.""

Majma Mohamed of Worcester was amongst the rally crowd and said there is love for Jews and Muslims. She called what's happening in Gaza a ""genocide,"" and believes U.S. tax dollars supporting Israeli violence are better spent addressing America's problems.

""We have a lot of issues in America and that money that has been given to fund a war is money that we need to build our health care system, our education system,"" she said. ""This is not money that should be sent to kill people.""

Mohamed continued, ""The people of Gaza are tired. They're exhausted. They want peace. They want back their land. They want freedom and I think it's the least that we can do. There's been so much suffering.""

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Why the World’s Greatest Brain Cartographer Wrote a Novel,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/93562-why-the-world-s-greatest-brain-cartographer-wrote-a-novel.html,"While neuroscientist George Paxinos was planning a trip to Spain, a friend suggested he visit Santiago de Compostela, where the bones of St. James are buried. “I thought of extracting some DNA to see what the guy looked like,” Paxinos says. “Then, I thought, why not someone far greater?”

Twenty-one years later, Paxinos is publishing the novel sparked in that moment. A River Divided is the story of a scientist who uses Christ’s remains to create two clones who then grow up on opposite sides of the planet, with diametrically opposed worldviews. The book explores the question of whether humans can exist in harmony with nature—and whether our brains are capable of addressing the climate crisis.

“The question the novel attempts to answer is, what would someone with the genetic endowment of Christ do if he were born today?” says Paxinos, a professor of medical sciences at Neuroscience Research Australia and the University of New South Wales, Sydney. “Would he join Wall Street or street protests?”

It’s an extremely compelling premise, but plenty of people come up with cool novel ideas, and Paxinos is a busy man. He is a world-renowned scientist who has identified and named more brain areas than anyone in history. He has published 57 books. His first, The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, is the most-cited neuroscience publication of all time. His Atlas of the Human Brain received awards from the Association of American Publishers and the British Medical Association. Paxinos is also an environmental activist who has worked to protect trees and bring light rail to Sydney.

With such a strong scientific platform and a history of direct action, why write a novel to address the climate change issue? “Because nothing else has worked,” Paxinos says. “It was failure leading to fiction. I reasoned there might be a better outcome if I worked upstream from behavior, at attitude change; that is, instead of trying to block someone from cutting a forest, to convince them to protect it. A novel can present to the public a balanced mix of romance and suspense with knowledge from neuroscience and environmental science that may foster a pro-environmental attitude.”

He explains that the human mind is ill-equipped to solve the environmental crisis. Had the brain been physically smaller, it would not have been able to support the science and technology that today threaten existence. If, on the other hand, the brain had been larger, it might have understood the problem, even solved it. His conclusion is that the brain is not in the Goldilocks zone.

In A River Divided, the twins’ paths cross when they find themselves on opposite sides of an almighty battle over the last great rainforest, the Amazon. The story resembles an ancient tragedy that ends with hope, at least for the two surviving protagonists. “That identical twins raised apart can end up as principal antagonists in the battle of the Amazon illustrates the importance of environment in the formation of character and points to education as a way to construct a sustainable society,” Paxinos says.

During the two decades he spent writing the book, Paxinos traveled around the world, immersing himself in many different environments, including Jerusalem, the Vatican, the Amazon, and Buenos Aires. “The travel was the easy part, with learning to tango in Buenos Aires being the most enjoyable,” he says. “I wanted the book to have authenticity in the description of cultures and landscapes.”

The writing part was tougher, but Paxinos says he never lost interest in the book because he could see the way it was improving. With each draft, he drew closer to completing this gripping tale that uses the power of empathy and conversation to connect readers with humanity’s most pressing problem.

One day, while writing in a café, he bumped into a friend who asked how the book was going. He told her he’d been at it for 21 years and still wasn’t finished. She said her cousin’s novel was published posthumously. Paxinos recalls saying to her, “You are giving me hope.”"," surprised her. “Why so long?” she asked. “It’s complicated,” he replied.George Paxinos, world-renowned neuroscientist and environmental activist, has spent two decades writing his novel A River Divided, which follows twin clones of Jesus Christ as they grapple with the climate crisis.

She wants to put her transition in the past. But it costs a lot of money to make it happen.

90 Day Fiance: Cleo Opens up about Transition

Cleo was open with fans about her life on Before the 90 Days. She reveals that she is a transgender woman who is also autistic. She even deals with mental health issues. It hasn’t been an easy journey for her. She feels that a lot of it has been due to “negative past experiences” and “gender dysphoria.”

Cleo posted on Instagram today that her and Christian broke up 🎉🎉 I’m happy for her, she deserves so much better#90dayfiancebeforethe90days #90dayfiance — 90 Day Opinonated (@90dayopinions) October 25, 2023

However, now the 90 Day Fiance reality star is giving more details about her transition. She started her transition journey 11 years ago. She thought that within five or six years, she would be able to reach her “medical transition goals.” But that wasn’t the case.

Over a decade later, Cleo has only been doing hormone replacement therapy. She reveals that she hasn’t been able to afford any other treatments relevant to her medical transition.

Cleo & Christian Split Up

Cleo isn’t able to feel like herself. And she explains that it affects every aspect of her life. It also stops her from entering a relationship with “strength and confidence.” Instead, it makes her really “needy” in a relationship.

The 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days castmate recently revealed that she and Christian split up. They struggled with the “complexities” of being in a long-distance relationship that was also in the public eye.

However, Cleo revealed that she will always love him. She also wishes him the best and tells fans not to send any hate his way. She knew that she had to work on herself before she could welcome someone else into her life. And that is what she is going to do.

Cleo doesn’t want to be in a relationship unless she is “okay” with herself. The TLC star doesn’t want to put anyone having to deal with her “anxieties and insecurities.” She wants to be able to be the “loving, caring person” she is in a relationship. She doesn’t want to have the extra layer of feeling insecure about herself and her body.

90 Day Fiance Celeb Starts Fundraiser

Cleo has explored many different avenues of trying to reach her goal. She has also tried “tirelessly” to afford transitioning over the past decade. But the “emotional and financial toll has become overwhelming” for her. She doesn’t have the funds to undergo gender confirmation procedures.

The 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days cast member wants to believe in the goodness of others and hope that people can help her be herself. So, she has decided to start a fundraiser to raise money for her medical transition. However, she wants people to put themselves first before donating. If it is something they can’t do, then just spreading the word means a lot to her.

Cleo is thankful for the support she gets. She feels it will help bring attention to the “struggles of the trans and neurodivergent communities.”

The Pacific Islands are the world’s most aid-reliant region, according to a new survey, as geopolitical competition for influence fuels record levels of development assistance.

Between 2008 and 2021, the Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map found that the Pacific Islands received more than $40bn in development assistance, with development finance playing a more significant role in these economies than any other part of the world.

Australia is the largest donor to the islands, providing about 40 percent of total development finance or $17bn between 2008 and 2021.

China is the next largest donor country, providing about $3.9bn.

Direct budget support to Pacific Island governments surged in 2021 to 40 percent of all development finance.

In 2021, the most significant transaction recorded by the Pacific Aid Map was Australia’s $466 million Australian-dollar ($297m) loan to Papua New Guinea.

“Pacific Island countries are home to some of the smallest, most remote, and internally dispersed populations in the world, posing significant challenges to realising more traditional development pathways”, said Alexandre Dayant, Deputy Director of the Lowy Institute’s Indo-Pacific Development Centre.

Economies among the Pacific Islands draw on a range of income, from tourism, fishing licences, commodity exports and overseas labour mobility, and climate change impacts – including rising sea levels and extreme weather events – threaten livelihoods, Dayant said.

The report released on Monday found that about 39 percent of all aid pledged to the region in 2021 was climate-related, but said climate financing is still below the levels needed.

While Australia and Japan significantly increased development support in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic, China shifted to “downsized, more politically targeted” aid, directing $241m to countries it had recently formed ties with, the report said.

Between 2013 and 2019, Chinese projects in the region “significantly decreased” from $40m to about $5m.","The Lowy Institute has found that the Pacific Islands are the world's most aid-reliant region, with Australia as the largest donor providing about 40 percent of total development finance from 2008-2021, followed by China with $3.9bn.

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,This is where South Africa’s money is going – BusinessTech,https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/728158/this-is-where-south-africas-money-is-going/,"South Africa’s institutional investors are increasingly turning to foreign equities amid a challenging South African environment.

Following his research into offshore investors, RMB Chief Economist Isaah Mhlanga said that there have been some notable shifts in the behaviour of local investors over the last three decades.

Allocation to cash increased from 8.4% in the 1990s to a peak of 9.3% in the 2000s before declining to 5.2% in the 2020s.

Domestic fixed income dropped from 28.8% in the 1990s and 2000s to 24.7% in 2010, with a marginal increase to 26.2% in the 2020s. Foreign fixed income has remained between 0.4% and 0.6% over the entire period.

The big changes are seen on the equities side, with domestic equities dropping from 45.6% in the 1990s to 35.2% in the 2020s, while foreign equities increased from 5% to 22.5% over the same period.

“There are several drivers for this observed asset allocation behaviour. First, domestic fixed income continues to offer relatively attractive real returns compared to offshore fixed income,” Mhlanga said

“Second, domestic equities tend to get dragged by poor growth fundamentals.”

The domestic listed equity market has also shrunk substantially compared to other regions and has become too concentrated.

Why this is happening

Although the global economic momentum continues to moderate from the post-pandemic recovery, the US economy has been resilient, buoyed by consumer spending.

Technology has driven US equities, but this appears to be waiting as the broad S&P 500 has dropped by 10% from its 31 July 2022 speak despite the strong growth narrative.

“Monetary policy has continued to tighten, although it is now at or close to the peak in many countries. Global central banks have continued to unwind pandemic-era liquidity, particularly the US Fed, driving up returns from money market funds, which have attracted significant capital,” Mhlanga added.

“Geopolitics have also added another return driver and layer of complexity to the energy and agricultural complex. One of the 2022 trades was buying energy and soft commodities and sitting back and watching the Russia-Ukraine war. The Hamas-Israel war might resuscitate the energy leg of that trade.”

For emerging markets, weakening currencies, growing debt levels and better US returns in money market funds are driving nonresident investors away – even if US fixed-income yields are now expected to drop.

In South Africa, high inflation, weak growth and Regulation 28 – which increased the amount that could be invested in international assets from 30% to 45% – have driven the market dynamics.

With local dynamics being so weak, offshore fixed income is anticipated to benefit.

“The shift in global sentiment towards US long-dated fixed income combined with a decline in the S&P 500 will likely continue the overweight offshore fixed income call,” Mhlanga added.

“For offshore investors, long duration is starting to pick up, which will encourage more outflows from EMs that have fiscal risks, such as South Africa. In the equity markets, US equity markets, excluding technology, have been underweight. This is likely to remain the case for some time as markets assess recession risks.”

“In the domestic market, equities broadly remain underweight, but there are pockets of value in the

small-caps and mid-caps.”

Grégoire Baudot left Goldman Sachs after nearly 20 years across the bank’s London, Paris, and New York offices. He was with the bank’s technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) team, having been made an MD in 2015. He joined PJT’s M&A team, known as the strategic advisory group, in New York earlier this month.

There’s no indication that Baudot was part of Goldman’s MD cull, but it seems unlikely. Boutique banks that are seeing rising revenues and profits (such as PJT) don’t tend to go for underperforming MDs. PJT is a pretty good place to end up if you are moving on from Goldman Sachs, anyway: the boutique grew its headcount by 10% YoY, per its last annual report, and pay went up even more – it’s on track to pay $820k per head this year. That’s along the lines of what a Goldman MD earns.

And there’s another harbinger of the sci-fi EV future going off rails, look no further than Detroit and its very retro kind of auto revolution: A union-led revival of middle class wages.

Over in Michigan, United Auto Workers employees are on the brink of victory after 44 days of striking for better wages and a slice of the big three’s massive profits from the past couple of years. It’s no secret that wages have stagnated since the 1970s, the last time American unions roared loudly, with the median wage barely budging when adjusted for inflation. And even though union membership is just 10% of all wage and salary workers nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the ones remaining in the blue-collar field are about to end a historic strike with a historically large wage increase. First Ford, then Stellantis and now General Motors have all agreed to the same deal with the UAW: a 4.5-year contract that introduces 25% general wage increases and cost of living adjustments that bring total pay raises up to 30%.

The pressure to pay up has caused the big three to let go (or at least ease up) of one of their favorite toy hot wheels— the shiny, game-changing electric vehicle. And that’s when it’s impossible to ignore Elon Musk and Tesla’s rough earnings season, as the market wakes up to the fact that it’s probably a car company, after all, not a tech firm. Musk is $41 billion less richer as a result.

Elon Musk and EVs’ very bad, no-good October

In Muskville, an abysmal Q3 earnings report knocked its icon off his ever-slipping tower. After earnings revealed margins of a distinctly Detroit-flavored variety, Tesla shares dropped from $255 per earnings to $197, trimming the worth of Musk’s 715 million shares from the ridiculous $182 billion to the merely absurd $141 billion.

It isn’t a great sign for the EV crowd, to say the least. “We’re transitioning to a brand new technology,” Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, told Fortune. “It’s expensive. It requires people to have a different relationship with their vehicle that has been largely unchanged for decades.”. But the Big Three car manufacturers increasingly sound like they can’t quite afford the EV revolution and the union’s new wages. It also might be an easy excuse to throw in the towel on EVs, at least to an extent.

The new contract with the UAW will likely cost Ford up to $2 billion per year in wages, per analysis from Barclays. While that’s just 1% of its revenue figure, it’s a major chunk of profits, which came at $1.2 billion last quarter. And Ford would have been more profitable if not for its EV efforts. Even so, it’s not a struggling company, as they were able to pay CEO Jim Farley $20 million just last year.

Still, EV is a straggler. This past spring, Ford revealed that it lost $722 million while wading into the business, losing $60,000 for each car sold. This October, after Ford became the first of the Big Three to reach a deal with the UAW, it kicked the can down the road on its EV dreams, indefinitely postponing a $12 billion investment on electric vehicles.

Finding less green in the (environmentally) green cars than anticipated, General Motors is also scaling back and giving up its plan to build 400,000 EVs from 2022 to 2024. Even with President Biden’s backing of the sector and the widespread hype that EVs would replace most gas guzzlers by the 2030s, the math isn’t working for Detroit right now—or Elon Musk.

Still, Biden’s goal is to have 50% of all vehicles be electric by 2030. It’s not one thing or another per say, as competitive workers pay or EVs don’t stand diametrically opposed to each other. But for now, it seems as if the big three are pumping the brakes on Biden’s dreams of green cars in order to make up for the cost of a new contract. And with cheap EVs flooding the market in China, although not yet available domestically, it’s not clear how the math is going to work out for Tesla and the Big Three.

But Detroit’s union has won a 30% raise through 2028 and they’re not done yet—as UAW president Shawn Fain told members that Toyota, Honda and Tesla are next. “One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we’ve never organized before,” Fain said on a Facebook livestream, as reported by The New York Times. “When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won’t just be with the Big Three. It will be the Big Five or Big Six.”

[This report has been updated to reflect an increase in Tesla’s share price from $196 to $197 in intraday trading.]"," union-led revival of middle class wages.After a historic 44-day strike, United Auto Workers employees have won the battle for better wages and a slice of the big three’s profits with a 4.5-year contract that introduces 25% general wage increases. Despite President Biden's goal to have 50% of all vehicles be electric by 2030, the big three are pumping the brakes on EV efforts to make up for the increased wages, and Elon Musk's Tesla has had a rough earnings season."

Good afternoon.

I am so happy to be here today. This is a tremendous moment for Canada, for the Canada Growth Fund, for the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), for Eavor Technologies Inc., and for Alberta.

I want to first acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional territories of the people of the Treaty 7 region in southern Alberta and the Métis Nation of Alberta, Region 3.

I am so glad to be back home in Alberta today. It was great to spend some time with the amazing people here at Eavor Technologies in Calgary. I want to thank you for the warm welcome.

I do want to start by taking a moment to thank the amazing team at the Canada Growth Fund and the amazing team at PSP Investments. It is your hard work that has made this announcement today possible.

And I want to say how nice it is that Rebecca Schulz, Alberta’s Minister of Environment and Protected Areas, is here. She and I worked together on another project that is so important for me—our national system of early learning and child care.

Fees here in Alberta have been reduced by 50 per cent. That is saving families up to $10,300 per child this year. And Alberta is on track to reach fees of just $10 a day in 2026. This is making such an important difference for families across Canada, across Alberta, and here in Calgary. So, thank you Rebecca for your partnership.

The great people here at Eavor are doing some incredibly important, innovative work—and in the years to come, that work will be more important than ever for Alberta, for Canada, and for the whole world.

That’s because today, the world’s major economies are moving at an unprecedented pace to fight climate change and retool their economies to build the net-zero industries of today and tomorrow.

Canada has to keep up. And we not only have to keep up—we need to be in the lead.

And we can be. That is why our clean economy jobs plan is making historic investments to build Canada’s clean economy and create a new generation of opportunities for Canadian workers and Canadian businesses.

One of those investments—which I really believe is going to be a game-changer for Canada’s clean economy—is the new $15 billion Canada Growth Fund, whose very first inaugural investment is being made right here, today, in this amazing company.

The Canada Growth Fund is led by some of Canada’s top investors, and it is going to invest in Canadian businesses, help them scale, and support Canadians in attracting our share of the trillions of dollars in private capital that are waiting to be invested in the global clean economy.

This Fund is going to help great Canadian companies, like Eavor, grow and keep their headquarters here in Canada, here in Calgary, and expand around the world from their Canadian base—as Eavor is already doing. And this investment is going to turbocharge that growth.

So, I am incredibly proud to announce that the Canada Growth Fund’s very first inaugural investment is being made in Eavor—right here in Calgary, here in Alberta.

This $90 million investment is going to help Eavor accelerate the deployment of its world-leading geothermal energy technology, which has the potential to significantly reduce emissions in Alberta, in Canada, and around the world.

Just as importantly, this investment is going to help protect and create great-paying careers for people right here in Calgary and across Alberta.

One of the wonderful things about this company and this technology is that the same skilled tradespeople and engineers who built the oil sands are using those skills to create renewable energy. And I think that is just fantastic.

So, I am glad that the very first investment by our flagship clean economy investment fund is being made here in Calgary, here in Alberta.

Because our government’s clean economy jobs plan was built with Alberta at its heart.

This province has the resources, the hardworking people, and the expertise that Canada—and the world—needs.

We need Alberta to be at the heart of a strong, growing, clean economy—one that powers Canada and the world and creates great middle-class careers for people across this wonderful province today and in the future.

I am really delighted to be here with Eavor today—because as a proud daughter of Alberta, I want the people of Alberta to know that our government believes in this incredible province and the remarkable and talented people who call Alberta home.

Today’s announcement—the first ever by the Canada Growth Fund—is concrete proof of that.

Thank you very much.","ils from the world’s most ambitious energy sector—and this historic investment is a great example of how we can build a better future for Canada, and for Alberta, while we continue to draw on Alberta’s great energy sector.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced the inaugural investment of the Canada Growth Fund into Calgary-based Eavor Technologies Inc., a company developing geothermal energy technology. The $90 million investment is designed to accelerate the deployment of the technology, reduce emissions in Alberta, and create new jobs."
2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,South Africa heading for a turn – BusinessTech,https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/727974/south-africa-heading-for-a-turn/,"South Africa’s economy will likely see a rebound in the next year and a half, outperforming its global counterparts.

According to Investec’s Global Investment Strategy Group’s (GISG) Q4 2024 Global Investment Outlook, the global GDP is expected to slow materially over the next 18 months, while the USA is expected to enter a recession.

The GISG said that earnings are thus expected to be below market consensus and that the US equity market offers little margin of safety.

“Global rates have increased rapidly, and we expect they will only drift down – a headwind for both the economy and the market. The GISG global risk score remains at -0.5,” Investec said.

The picture in South Africa, however, is better than the global average, with a GISG risk of 0.5.

Source: Investec

Investec said a cut in South African interest rates is not far away as South African inflation should be within the Reserve Bank’s target of 3% to 6% for the rest of the year.

The South African Reserve Bank is expected not to wait for the US Fed to make its first cut, with 75 basis points worth of cuts predicted for the next year.

The biggest risk to inflation and interest rate cuts is the oil price, but this is unlikely to rise given the predicted global slowdown.

“The South African economy is currently weak, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel,” the experts added.

Certain pieces of economic data are weak, such as vehicle sales, retail sales, credit extension and nominal GDP growth.

That said, inflation has dropped significantly over the last six months, with expected rate cuts to add some relief.

Furthermore, the worst of load shedding is likely behind us due to the large amount of solar imports.

Despite global growth being predicted to slow down over the next year and the nation’s economic issues, the rand should strengthen over the next 18 months.

“Our model estimate of fair value for the rand against the US dollar is around 17.5, even if South Africa is removed from AGOA, and materially stronger if South Africa remains in AGOA.”

South African equities and fixed income are also cheap, and “SA Inc.” companies should see margin expansion and higher volumes as diesel costs decline and rate cuts stimulate the economy.

“While the election next year increases the risk that National Treasury will be less fiscally prudent than normal, we see sufficient margin of safety in South African bonds to retain an overweight position,” Investec added.

Read: Pension warning for South African emigrants","South Africa's economy is predicted to outperform its global counterparts in the next year and a half, with a cut in interest rates expected in the near future. The predicted global slowdown and lower oil prices should help to strengthen the rand. Additionally, equities and fixed income are seen to be cheap, while there is a margin of safety in South African bonds."
2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Cooper announces 500 jobs as global battery component supplier selects ...,https://greensboro.com/news/community/rockingham_now/cooper-announces-500-jobs-as-global-battery-component-supplier-selects-brunswick-county/article_e5c42eec-772d-11ee-94ec-db3c1a63167d.html,"RALEIGH - Epsilon Advanced Materials, Inc., a global provider of synthetic graphite used in electric vehicle batteries, will build its first manufacturing facility in the United States in Brunswick County, creating 500 jobs, Governor Roy Cooper announced last Thursday. The Indian-based company will invest $649.9 million at the Mid-Atlantic Rail Industrial Park.

“North Carolina continues to lead the way in the transition to a clean energy economy by attracting good-paying jobs from great companies like Epsilon that make our state stronger and healthier,” said Governor Cooper. “This historic investment will bring 500 clean energy jobs to Brunswick County, helping both our economy and our environment.""

Epsilon Advanced Materials (EAM), a subsidiary of Mumbai-based Epsilon Carbon Private Limited, was established in 2018 to develop and manufacture innovative, high-performance graphite, used for anode components in lithium-ion batteries. Graphite anode materials deliver highly sought properties in batteries, such as fast charging, long cycle life, and safety. The technology has proven its scalability to mass production, positioning the company to meet the rapidly growing demand for renewable energy storage. The company’s project in Brunswick County will establish the company’s first manufacturing facility in the United States to produce synthetic graphite anode material, a key component in the batteries that power electric vehicles and other energy storage systems.

“This facility is the largest Indian investment in the U.S. electric vehicle battery industry and we’re proud to have North Carolina as the centerpiece of our U.S. manufacturing strategy,” said Vikram Handa, EAM Founder and Managing Director. “Having an environmentally friendly world-class facility in North Carolina will allow EAM to provide synthetic and natural graphite anodes to the growing EV battery industry faster, more reliably and at a competitive cost.”

“The importance of a strong, well-trained workforce cannot be underestimated, and I’m pleased the leaders at Epsilon Advanced Materials recognize North Carolina’s commitment to train and develop our workers,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Machelle Baker Sanders. “Combined with the state’s outstanding transportation networks and collaborative business environment, North Carolina’s winning formula has come through once again.”

The North Carolina Department of Commerce led the state’s support for the company during its site evaluation and decision-making process.

Although wages will vary depending on the position, the average salary for the new positions will be $52,264. The current average wage in Brunswick County is $46,464.

Epsilon Advanced Materials’ project in North Carolina will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee earlier today. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $1.3 billion. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $3,443,250, spread over 12 years. State payments only occur following performance verification by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets. JDIG projects result in positive net tax revenue to the state treasury, even after taking into consideration the grant’s reimbursement payments to a given company.

Because Epsilon chose a site in Brunswick County, classified by the state’s economic tier system as Tier 3, the company’s JDIG agreement also calls for moving $1.14 million into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account. The Utility Account helps rural communities finance necessary infrastructure upgrades to attract future business. Even when new jobs are created in a Tier 3 county such as Brunswick, the new tax revenue generated through JDIG grants helps other economically challenged communities elsewhere in the state.

“We’re so excited to welcome a global manufacturer to one of the state’s premier megasites, the Mid-Atlantic Rail Industrial Park,” said N.C. Senator Bill Rabon. “Many companies find our state’s southeast region an inviting place to locate, and we’re confident Epsilon Advanced Materials will also enjoy the many advantages of a Brunswick County business location.”

“Today’s decision by Epsilon Advanced Materials proves once again that North Carolina is one of the best business locations in the United States,” said N.C. Representative Frank Iler. “Many people in our community worked hard to bring these jobs to our region and we will continue to work together to support this company’s continued growth in our state.”

Partnering with the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina on this project were the North Carolina General Assembly, North Carolina Community College System, the North Carolina Ports Authority, North Carolina Department of Transportation and Rail Division, the North Carolina Railroad Company, the GoldenLEAF Foundation, North Carolina’s Southeast, CSX, Duke Energy, Brunswick County, and Brunswick Business & Industry Development.","Indian-based company Epsilon Advanced Materials (EAM) will invest $649.9 million in a new facility in Brunswick County, NC, creating 500 jobs and facilitating a Job Development Investment Grant that could result in a net tax revenue to the state of up to $3.4 million over 12 years. Average wages for the new positions will be $52,264, above the current average wage in Brunswick County of $46,464. The project is expected to contribute $1.3 billion to the state's economy."

""From today the real #LivingWage rate increases to £12 in the UK and £13.15 in London,"" the Living Wage Foundation said. ""Long-term champion of the real Living Wage @MartinSLewis explains why the need for a real Living Wage based on the cost of living has never been more essential.""

The Living Wage Foundation said its rates will increase to £12 an hour outside London - a rise of £1.10 - and to £13.15 an hour in the capital - a £1.20 increase. The foundation said the 10% rise, coming into effect on Tuesday, reflects ""persistently high costs"" for low-paid workers.

The voluntary rate, which applies to everyone over the age of 18, compares to the statutory National Living Wage for over-23s of £10.42 an hour. A full-time worker earning the new Real Living Wage will earn £3,081 a year more than someone on the current government minimum, and an additional £5,323 in London, according to the foundation.

In the video, Mr Lewis said: ""Hello, I'm delighted - truly delighted - to be part of this announcement. I have been a long-term supporter for a simple reason: ""I'm the Money Saving Experr."" Mr Lewis said the wage will provide ""better value"" and said: ""Without a basic income, none of this is possible.

""Hundreds of thousands still have minimum expenditure higher than their income - and it's not a situation we should have. It has a massive impact on wellbeing... on mental health, on physical health. It's why I applaud the organisation and why I applaud all the companies who have signed up.

The company, which quarries aggregates, manufactures concrete and has contracting subsidiaries, saw revenue rise from £1.81bn to £2bn, according to accounts for the year ending 31 December 2022.

Tarmac’s pre-tax profit stood at £125.9m, down sharply from £263.1m in 2021.

However, the firm said this was “primarily a result of the impairment reversals in the prior-year results, not replicated in the current year”. These added £85m to the 2021 balance sheet.

“Once these are removed, underlying trading has improved in the year […] driven by robust growth in the UK construction sector of 5.6 per cent in 2022 (Office for National Statistics data),” a statement alongside the accounts said.

“This was underpinned by strong activity in the housing market together with continued growth in infrastructure spending.

“Cost inflation continued to be a factor during the period. However, the company was able to recover this through targeted price increases during the year.”

The year was marked by huge cost inflation, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Last month, the Construction Leadership Council said price inflation in the sector had stabilised, but warned that its impact continued to put pressure on smaller contractors.

The results for Tarmac Trading Ltd, the parent company of several UK firms including contractors Farrans and Alun Griffiths, also show that its headcount grew. The firm employed 2,782 people in 2022, up from 2,437 in 2021. Tarmac Trading is itself a subsidiary of CRH, a Dublin-headquartered multinational.

Earlier this month, results for the same period for civils contractor Alun Griffiths – which Tarmac acquired for £36m in 2018 – showed a £20m pre-tax loss on turnover of £301m. The firm has lost £74.5m in the past four years.","Tarmac boosted its UK revenue and underlying profitability in 2022 through price increases and robust growth in the construction sector, according to its latest accounts.

The annual Roundtable, now in its fifth year, brings together Canadian capital markets stakeholders, including regulators, standard-setters and audit firms to share perspectives on the recent developments in audit quality in Canada. The roundtable provided an important forum to discuss key issues and priorities that are needed to support the integrity of financial reporting in Canada.

The topics discussed include:

Risks impacting external audits.

The role of governance and culture within an audit firm, particularly with regards to audit quality.

Observations on the implementation of the new Canadian auditing standard on quality management systems.

Fraud detection and prevention.

Developments in sustainability and climate disclosure reporting standards and practices.

Risks related to emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts implementation.

Public confidence in the integrity of financial reporting in Canada is fundamental to well-functioning strong capital markets. Roundtable participants reaffirmed their shared commitment to fostering a robust Canadian financial system by maintaining open and proactive engagement, acting on issues early and in a coordinated manner.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

An important element of maintaining confidence in Canada’s capital markets is the consistent execution of high-quality audits that maintain confidence in audited financial statements of Canadian reporting issuers.

Audit firms continue to invest time and resources in the design, implementation and operation of quality management systems that are foundational to audit quality and to achieving consistent execution. Audit firms must emphasize a firm culture where auditors are recognized and rewarded for prioritizing the public interest.

The fraud risk landscape continues to evolve. Many firms are implementing or piloting new approaches including the use of technology and the increased utilization of forensic specialists to address these evolving risks.

Audit firms have begun to consider and address climate-related risks in their audit risk assessments of financial statements. There are opportunities to evolve the depth and consistency of these assessments.

Increased use of emerging technologies create new opportunities to enhance audit quality but also introduce new risks. As digital innovations become increasingly sophisticated and complex, audit firms must be prepared to address the associated risks.

A continuing shift in the risk environment may lead to increased risk in credit, liquidity and going concern issues. Sufficient consideration of the impact of these stressors is an important component of audit quality.

QUOTES

2023-10-30T00:00:00.0000000,Financial update offers options even in difficult climate,https://news.eastsussex.gov.uk/2023/10/30/financial-update-offers-options-even-in-difficult-climate/,"OPTIONS are being explored to balance next year’s budget without reducing services despite huge financial pressures, council leaders will be told.

A report due to go before cabinet next week suggests options to be considered could include raising council tax and using some of the authority’s very limited reserves, with the council facing an expected shortfall of £27.5 million in the 2024/25 budget.

Councillors will also be warned that the picture in following years looks extremely difficult without more support from the government.

The cabinet report highlights that: “Our robust process, applied over many challenging years, has placed the council in a stronger position than many other authorities grappling with similar issues in the short term… This has enabled us to provide welcome stability in our services and the support we offer to local people.”

With considerable national uncertainty about how local government will be funded, East Sussex County Council is facing a predicted shortfall of £37 million between 2025 and 2027.

Like local authorities across the country, the county council is facing growing pressures from high demand for support for children and families, and for adults and older people needing care, as well as increased costs of providing services.

The cabinet report adds: “Given the national issues at play, we are experiencing similar significant financial pressures to others and now face a renewed challenge to maintain the decent and effective services our residents need and deserve in the medium term.”

The report stresses the need to continue the lobbying of central government as “without further government support or sustainable reform of local government finances we will not have the funding we need in the medium term.”

It also highlights the importance of the council’s work to harness the benefits of new technology and new ways of working to ease the pressures the authority faces.

With difficult decisions in the years ahead, the council wants to better understand the views of those living and working in the county and is launching a survey today (October 30) on the priorities and budget for East Sussex.

Feedback from the survey, alongside discussions with key partners and groups representing local communities will inform firm cabinet recommendations and full council decisions on the county council’s budget and Council Plan in early 2024.

Ms Creagh said despite this, auction clearance rates are holding “pretty firm” with the uplift in stock coming to the market, which reflects the improvement in conditions on the ground.

She also said there were “really challenging conditions” in the rental market.

“Certainly, playing into that stronger housing demand environment that we see manifest itself this year,” Ms Creagh told Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood.

“So certainly, you know rental market conditions incredibly challenging … rental prices have increased about 15 per cent in the past year – in Sydney, that’s even more.”

More than 7.9 million people have already filed their returns and there is still time for those yet to do so, with the official deadline on October 31.

Come November 1, anyone who has not lodged their tax return themselves or registered with a tax agent will be slugged with a $313 fine.

This increases every 28 days, up to a maximum of five times, H&R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman said, meaning taxpayers who fail to lodge their returns over that additional period could cop a maximum penalty of $1565.

But, research has found that 47 per cent of self-employed Australians, including tradies, beauticians and contractors are yet to file their tax returns and 17 per cent haven’t started them at all.

The research, done by tax and accounting service Hnry, found that half of those who have completed their returns reported a lower rebate compared to previous years and due to this, many others are choosing to put off submitting their return.

“Our research shows sole traders spend an average of six hours on financial admin every week,” said Karan Anand, managing director of Hnry Australia, a tax automation tool for sole traders.

“Add to that the pressure of tax time while forking out a large sum to potentially receive a smaller rebate following the phasing out of the Low and Middle Income Tax Offset (LMITO), and it’s no wonder a large proportion are putting off submitting their return.

“That’s despite the prospect of a $313 late fine.”

But for those who are running behind and miss the official deadline, there is a way to lodge the return much later than the October 31 deadline without being fined.

“You simply need to be registered as a tax agent client by 31 October 2023, and you can lodge your tax return through that agent as late as 15 May 2024,” Chapman said.

Another key date to remember is November 21. This is when anyone who owes a tax bill must cough up the cash to the ATO.

Again, anyone using a registered tax agent may have a later due date.

Many taxpayers received a lower refund than expected this year, or even a tax bill.

“If you don’t receive a refund this year, and you don’t have a bill, it means you’ve paid the correct amount of tax throughout the year,” ATO Assistant Commissioner Rob Thomson said recently.

“You may receive a bill for a number of reasons, one of which could be because you didn’t pay enough tax.

“If you’ve received a tax bill, you need to pay it in full and on time to avoid interest charges. If you are experiencing financial difficulties, we’re here to help. You can contact us or speak to your tax agent before the due date to discuss the support available.”","Australians have until October 31 to lodge their tax returns or face a $313 fine. Those who have already filed their returns have reported a lower rebate than usual, while 17 per cent have yet to start it. The ATO is reminding taxpayers who owe a bill that it must be paid in full and on time to avoid interest charges."
